Ha Gow Dim Sum House,2,2019-09-24,"We were in the neighborhood and couldn't decide what to eat so we did what others would do in our situation which was to bust out our phones and go on Yelp for suggestions! Well Yelp led us to this place based on its high ratings but I'm sad to say that Yelp has failed me again.  This restaurant's dimsum quality was not good. The curry cuttlefish was very watery and bland, their chicken feet had a weird taste, their sui mai was okay but again kind of bland, their spare ribs was full of fat and the list goes on and on with negative things to say about their other dishes. None was good!

Service was okay but their debit machine was down and I didn't have cash on me and when I asked if they take e- transfers, they said no. So I had to drive out to a bank to get cash which was a bit of a pain but of well.

Definitely will not comes back to this one.",0
Campechano Taquería,4,2019-06-26,"A great spot for some tacos!

Been meaning to go here for a while and after 1hr in Costco followed by the lovely prime time traffic back to King West it was time!!

Firstly, defo aim to go when its sunny and sit outside, the outdoor area is nice and if you can get in the little secluded section you may never leave.

On the tacos i had the Haddock Fish Taco, the Steak and Chorizo and the Chicken ones - I warn now do not be as greedy as me 3 of these tacos was too much of course i ate them but 2 is well enough.

The fish one was only ok but the Steak Taco was one of the best I have had...the chicken also is a treat so go for them 2.

All the ingredients felt fresh and each taco came with different toppings to compliment the meats which which they did perfectly!

Absolutely worth a go if your a taco fan, just don't be surprised when you accidentally spend over 100$

PS - The cocktails are unique and amazing, the Pina-Mojito is a must try ...hmmm maybe this is why i cleared 100$

PPS - Get chips and Guac, its good and free refills on the chips.",2
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2019-12-23,"Amazing food and drinks. The place is more casual and I loved the decoration. We went at autumn so we could still stay at the patio.

The only thing is that my food was supposed to go in the oven, so my husband dish came first. He finished his meal and then I finally got mine. We complained nicely to the server, but I don't think it made difference. 
I also had a frozen Margherita (which I liked very much) But overall, it's a nice place.",1
King’s Tacos,3,2019-08-16,Had to check this place out after my friends raved about its authenticity. Staff and servers are warm and welcoming. We ordered take out and didn't have to wait too long. I had the chicken tacos which I found to be dry. May have to try the beef ones next time.,1
Giulietta,3,2019-04-26,"This restaurant is now on the top 10 list for the best restaurants in Canada.  I came here before the list came out and I have to say I am extremely underwhelmed.  There are much better restaurants in Toronto that deserve to take its place on the list, and especially much better ITALIAN in Toronto.

I had the calamari to start which was fresh and came with some shishito peppers which was fun.  But I find nowadays calamari is pretty good at most places.  For the mains I had the ravioli (cello spinach, stracciatella, walnut pesto) which is not a dish that would bring me back to the restaurant again.  I found the walnut pesto to be overpowering and very gritty/thick, but to be fair I actually don't like walnut that much.  

The pizza I had was thin crust and just nothing amazing.  There is MUCH better pizza elsewhere all over Toronto.  I have NO idea how this restaurant made it to the top restaurant list in Canada and I will not be coming back again.  I am giving 3 stars because the service is FANtastic and the restaurant is beautiful.",1
King’s Tacos,4,2020-02-16,"Didn't expect much going into the restaurant but was quite surprised by how roomy it is inside. They can easily host parties with reservations.

We ordered a burrito and one of the make-your-own tacos. Everything was nicely seasoned and they had free chips to start. They also offered 3 types of dips ranging from mild to spicy. Great service with big portions of food. Would come back again",2
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,4,2019-02-17,"Finally had the opportunity to come here after hearing all the great things about this place. Very upscale and posh vibe. 

Servers were descriptive with the menu and was very at tentative. Made great recommendations.

Oysters tasted fresh. Table side Cesar salad was great. Ribeye was well cooked but still tough and chewy. Wasn't particularly well seasoned which is why the side salt and sauces were provided. Could have lived without the rapini and mushroom. Bone marrow is a must. 

Independently a very great experience but tainted from just coming back from Japan.",2
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,5,2019-09-21,"This is a restaurant meant for dining in large groups. The food is delicious and good quality seafood, with large quantities, depending on the option you choose. One thing to keep in mind is that the menu options are a bit on the higher budget scale, but the portions are quite good. The highlight dishes are the lobster tower, crab tower, and deep fried oysters.

Make sure to call in advance and reserve a table.",2
El Catrin Destileria,4,2019-12-14,"Love, love, love this place. 

There are not a lot of great Mexican restaurants in Toronto.
Look no further than this spot for a great meal.

Their ceviche and fish tacos are da bomb..
Margaritas come in a variety of flavors and as a single drink or by the pitcher.

Do not miss the churros as a finish.  They come with multiple dipping sauces and are great!

They have a great patio in the summertime. 
It gets busy too!  

It's located in the Distillery District.  Green P parking right on the site at a fee. 
This area has a lot of cobblestone walkways so leave the high heels at home.",2
La Carnita,3,2019-09-22,"I'll start off by saying that I firmly believe that people come here for the atmosphere. It's a great place to just hang out, enjoy the music, and the drinks ! The taco's aren't the best I've ever had...nor are they the worst tacos either. You're paying almost $6 for ONE little TINY sample sized taco. So you don't get your money's worth at all.  They have quite a bit of options to choose from when it comes to tacos which is actually a pro to this place( except for when some options are sold out..). A huge con to me would be the fact that some of my tacos were cold by the time it got to me.. another huge con would be the service. Considering that there were literally 4 customers seated you would have expected them to be a lot more attentive, but that wasn't the case. Anyways the chances of me returning to eat are extremely low. Might just stop in to have a drink if I'm ever in the area though...HOWEVER if you do decide to give this place a try..  go for the shrimp taco ! 

$60 dollars later... stomach was still growling and I had to head over to McDonalds. ...",1
DaiLo,2,2019-04-23,"One of the few restaurants I was most excited for but was left the most disappointed... Based on the reviews and pictures I came here with high expectations, unfortunately my experience was very underwhelming.

My friends and I ordered the crispy octopus tacos, hakka brown wontons, torched tamari glazed beef carpaccio, sichuan braised beef and the whole fried giggie trout. My table all agreed that the tacos were delicious and the best out of everything, and since this was the first dish brought to us we had very high hopes for the rest of our dinner. 

The rest of our food were just mediocre - it wasn't BAD but it wasn't to die for either. It honestly tasted like stuff we can make at home, which some people may not mind but my friends and I were expecting the fusion tastes to be more noticeable and long the lines of tastes we've never tried or experienced. The flavours/tastes didn't compliment each other or stood out to us at all, so we didn't really experience the ""fusion"" in any of the dishes except for the tacos. 

Some of the criticism agreed by my entire table for certain dishes were:

- the braised beef tasted exactly like the beef in pho, which is weird because the seasoning is completely different
- the wontons were a bit too salty 
- the trout was a bit too oily for us
- not enough sauces on the beef carpaccio, so it was too plain

Not only were the tastes not there, the portions were ridiculously small for the price (especially the tacos), aside from the trout. We usually order the same amount of food for 4 girls elsewhere and never finish - we finished all of the food here and were still hungry! Our final bill was $200 on the dot after taxes which is supposed to be AVERAGE I guess... but not worth it at DaiLo because we weren't full/satisfied. I feel like we could've spent the same amount elsewhere and gotten a better experience with food and actually be full afterwards. 

Despite the food not meeting our expectations, service was outstanding and impeccable. Our server was very patient with us and answered all of our questions, and explained each dish that came out beautifully. Our waters were always filled, and dishes were cleared quickly so our table was never too crowded. It was very quick to get his attention too when needed. 

Would I come back? Most likely not. I applaud DaiLo for trying with the the whole fusion scene but it just didn't work for us. The ""fusion"" additions they tried weren't enough to make most of the dishes stand out to us, the dishes tasted far too familiar at home... Sucks because we all really wanted to like this place!",0
House of Gourmet,3,2019-10-08,"Spontaneous craving for Chinese food but wanting to give other restaurants a chance in Chinatown led me to House of Gourmet. 

Portions are on the smaller side and they were decent enough to satisfy cravings. Wasn't much of a wow factor in my opinion. Ordered Yeung Chow fried rice, sweet and sour pork, beef soya sauce noodles, turnip cakes and snow peas for a group of 4. Topped it off with a iced lemon tea each.",1
Fudao noodle house,3,2019-08-18,"I think I ordered the wrong broth here. I probably would have enjoyed my meal much more but the broth was overpowering, a lot more pungent than I'm used to. But I powered through it and it ended up being good. So point is, don't get the pickled vegetable with pork broth unless you know what you're getting into! I wish I could come here to try more soups. I love the concept: Piping hot soup still boiling as you dip the veggie and other condiments in. Add a few slices of pork and then the noodles as your last bet. Very presentable and affordable!",1
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,4,2019-09-22,"Pros:
1. The shrimp & cheese taco (only 1 taco...) is delicious.
2. The taco finishes with a layer of cheese and pickled onion, quite guilty :) 
3. And a layer of meat at the bottom!

Cons:
1.long lineup 
2. $2 higher than other places in Kensington Market.",2
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,5,2019-12-30,"A little on the pricy side but that's what you get when you dine in Yorkville. The dim sum is honestly very good, surpassed only perhaps in value by the crown princess a little further down Bay street. A few non-dim sum dishes are excellent as well, including their Singapore noodles and Bok Choy. 

Their staff are as professional as they come. A very pleasant dim sum experience",2
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,4,2018-11-26,Got to this place recently. The shrimp dumplings were delicious. At least to my tastes. It has been a long time since I last got dim sum so I can't really compare to other places but I certainly enjoyed my meal and would like to come back again.,2
Ramen Isshin,5,2020-03-11,"This is my favourite Ramen place!
As aways they didn't disappoint me. I had the Stone Bowl Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen and my friend had the Garlic Shoyu Ramen and to finish off I got the Mochi for the first time as a dessert. Stone Bowl Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen was unique! Its cold noodle and you dip the cold noodle into the hot pot! Highly recommend it!",2
Hacienda las Américas,2,2019-01-04,"I really want to write a nicer review for this place because the food is amazing. And $2.50 fish tacos cannot be beat. The sign advertising said fish tacos is what reeled us in. 

But the service was just abysmal. 

My husband and I were eating around Toronto, so we were ordering small plates everywhere we went so we could get the best of all worlds. We ordered their three for $10 tacos (chicken, pork, and beef) and an extra fish taco for $2.50. All the tacos were amazing, the pork being our favourite and the beef, although good, was our least favourite (it was a bit dry). However, the server seemed annoyed that the two of us were ordering so little. We weren't offered side plates to share the tacos, so they were dripping everywhere and we struggled not to make a mess. We were never offered any water and their sauces were very spicy. Thankfully we had our own. And the thing that irked me most was that we were overcharged $1.50 for our tacos. They write the receipts by hand and were originally charged $10 for the three tacos, but they scratched that out and wrote $11.50. Not a huge deal. I asked why we were overcharged and the server said it's because we mixed and matched our tacos. She was kind of rude when I asked. But all the other reviews seem like it's $10 for three tacos regardless of mixing them up. I think they were mad we took up a table and tried to make it up in other ways. I couldn't care less about $1.50, but I don't like shady business practices.",0
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2019-02-27,"My husband and I went to this cute taqueria last week. I liked the simple ordering process of ordering your food at the counter and then eating in a tucked away back area of the narrow restaurant that was decorated with colourful pennant flags, strings of lights and wooden furniture (some high top tables, others were little booths). I appreciated the cute street food dining type of vibe in there, as well as the friendly staff at the counter and who brought the food to our table.

We ordered the carnita burrito bowl and the grilled fish burrito bowl since we thought it would be more filling than getting just the tacos. When our burrito bowls arrived, each bowl was filled with fresh vegetables, cheese and sour cream to accompany the grilled fish and pork. While the bowls were definitely filling, they were just okay in terms of flavour. I have to admit, it was a bit underwhelming considering the great reviews this place has gotten. Nothing really stood out - I would have loved to taste more of a marinade on the carnitas and the fish was a bit plain. More seasoning or sauces on the protein would have helped the flavours come together more in the burrito bowl. Again, not a horrible meal by any means but not really memorable either... personally, it was a bit of a miss for me on this particular visit but I may come back another time to try some of their other offerings to see if I can upgrade this review.",1
Como En Casa,2,2019-07-05,"Based on the ratings and reviews I was very excited to check this place out. I ordered a ""large chicken burrito"" which cost 14$. I got a really authentic vibe when I walked in. However, the burrito was one of the cheapest ones I've ever eaten. I asked for guacamole.... no guacamole. It was majority lettuce, rice, and bread from the overlapped wrap. Had to search just to find any chicken, very minimal. It was very dry, barely any sauce. Cheese was not good quality. All flavours were very bland. Extremely disappointing, for $14 I expect at minimum good size/quantity but didn't even get that.",0
Ho Ho Barbeque,2,2019-10-08,I was disappointed with this place for the price they charge their portion is so small I got the duck with rice barely any duck a bunch of cheapscapes the duck was okay honestly the duck at congee Queen was better price and way better taste last time I'm coming here,0
Ramen Isshin,2,2020-05-20,"I love Ramen and every winter I'm in Japan . Was dying to try   legendary vegan Isshin ramen  since my English teaser highly recommended . TOO SALTY!! 
In Toronto way more better places . May b other dishes would tests batter , I never back to that one . 
Hope it helps",0
Blu Ristorante,5,2019-04-27,"The food was sooooo amazing! And the service was extremely good! I went there with my friend, and we both were extremely satisfied!",2
98 Aroma,3,2017-09-01,"5/5 venue. Super clean (even the washrooms) for a Chinatown establishment and beautiful interior design -- traditional Beijing palace style! Super cool place to take a date or someone not so familiar with the Chinese culture for an ""authentic"" experience.......

But 3/5 food. Why? No major flaws with taste or quality, but unfortunately the dishes are just kind of boring. The regional cuisine served here is northeastern Chinese, which is my specialty since I hail from Shandong, as do the owner and some of the staff! I find the dishes very clean in that I feel that 98 Aroma uses less corn starch, oil, sodium, and possibly MSG than many other Chinatown restaurants.

3/5 value. Portion sizes are reasonable, but don't expect anything huge that would last for a week for under $10 like at House of Gourmet, etc. Pricier than most Chinese restaurants, but 98 Aroma can get away with this since they do have a swankier and more fusion feel. Think R&D, but with more Chinese-influence. A good place to take your Caucasian coworkers or in-laws, but not to dine alone just because. 

A few notes about specific dishes-

1. I've had the soups here before and the Hot & Sour soup is actually a huge portion even as a small size. The delicate mushrooms soup is not as substantial, so cannot stand alone as a meal.

2. Do order the Summer Breeze Veggie Salad (vegan) -- and make sure you MIX it well as all the sauce (and flavor) is at the bottom of the bowl. $9.99. Big portion, enough to share between 2 people or have as a lighter meal. I loved the textures and glass noodles.

3. Very mediocre Assorted Delicate Veggies (vegan). Broccoli, celery, carrots, and fried tofu. $14.99. Way too basic.

4. My gfs had the scallion pancakes, which looked more cooked and crispier than the ones my mom makes at home, but gfs enjoyed these. 

5. Can't remember the menu name, but gfs ordered a huge ass chicken udon stew, which was massive. They really liked the chicken and flavors here. 

6. Fried green beans with minced beef -- beans were oily and gfs weren't a fan. $13.99.

They take credit, debit cards at no extra charge. We didn't make a reservation for 7PM on a Friday night and were seated immediately, so customer volume is definitely not as high as it used to be a year ago.

Overall, would return, but only with Chinese food novices or for a special occasion.",1
El Nahual Tacos,2,2019-09-10,"To be completely honest. I was expecting more.
I came in during my lunch while practically salivating on hearing the reviews. I ordered the 3 TACOS: FISH, BARBACOA? AND CARNITAS. fish taco was so bland and had no taste. The beef was pretty good. CARNITAS was decent. Service left more to be desired as the gentleman never asked if I wanted anything else but just requested I pay. Felt rushed.!",0
Xola Mexican Food,1,2020-01-29,"I came her few weeks ago. I straight up saw this lady (pretty sure the owner) handle cash/ scratch her head and touched the food right after. I

Of course I only had a few bites and left the rest cause I was so grossed out. When I was paying for my bill, I let her know what I saw and she started giving racist quotes. ""All the chinese places do the same thing"", and walked away.

I would have just left it and not think twice, but for them to say something like that, that is a big nono. 

McDonalds food is higher quality than this. 

DO NOT COME HERE.",0
Stelvio,3,2020-02-15,"The decor was nice and the staff were all very friendly and helpful but it was a veeeery long wait for our main course. I had the Tagliatelle special with sausage, mushroom and black truffles and it was ok, I wasn't that impressed. I wouldn't order it again. But others at my table enjoyed their meals.",1
Asian Legend,3,2019-11-23,"Since living in LA and having a chance to go to Din Tai Fung whenever I wanted, it makes it really hard to think anywhere else could be better. This place was authentic and tastes like bistro dim sum. We got the soup dumplings, shrimp steamed dumplings, and scallion beef rolls.",1
Swatow Restaurant,4,2019-06-14,"Toronto has an authentic Chinatown. Though not quite as vibrant as San Francisco or New York, we found a very good place to eat. 

The won ton soup was plentiful and filled with fresh bok choy and too many noodles to eat. Three of us shared this. Then we had the general tao chicken which was tasty but not overly spicy. And had a sliced beef over rice dish which was also flavorful. 

All in all much better than we can get in Detroit. We enjoyed the meal and would come back but wouldn't feel like we had to come back.",2
Comal y Canela,3,2019-03-10,"Don't expect a Chipotle/Taco Bell type place!

Parking:  There is drive-thru parking for this plaza, but lot was full of deep potholes.  It's best to park on Macdonald Ave.  It's a small residential street, just north of Lawrence.

Restaurant itself is SMALL.  There are 4 tables and a counter with a few stools.  Restaurant opens early for Desayunos.

I believe this restaurant specialises in Michoacan food, the birthplace of canitas, low and slow cooked meats, and stews such as pozole.  Prices for specialty items were on the ""higher end"", e.g. pozole was $15 and a Michoacano Burrito (snout-to-tail, slow cooked pork), $15.  There wasn't much sauce in the burrito itself, no rice, just meat.  It was nicely cooked, but quite porkie.

Overall, the tastes are quite different than, let's say, your typical taco places downtown.  It's more about regional cooking.

Area seems a bit rough, so some of the prices did surprise me.  Ok to try, but I wouldn't drive out of my way (esp at night) to head there!",1
Mariachi’s Restaurant,2,2018-10-13,"Went there on a Sat night at 6pm for dinner before a movie.  
On the plus side the service was reasonably good.  
On the minus side:
1. The prices were much higher than the menu on their website.  This was misleading.
2. The food was small in both flavour and quantity.  

There are far better Mexican restaurants in the area.",0
Swatow Restaurant,4,2020-03-06,"The portions are huge. The place is in chinatown and is always busy. The food is your typical yummy, greasy, Chinese food. 

We had the chicken fried rice and the shrimp noodles. Everything tasted really good",2
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,2,2018-08-17,"Sweet and sour soup was good. Dumplings were good.  Our meals were bleh. Had Tsao chicken, which looked very nice but was more deep fried pieces than chunks of chicken.  My spouse had chicken with ginger and scallions which he enjoyed. A friend had some beef dish that was indescribable.",0
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2017-12-09,"It's pretty good Mexican food, and the atmosphere is cute. I sometimes come here for lunch when I am at work. Service is friendly and the food is decent. I've ordered the tacos, nachos and the churros. Can't go wrong.",1
7 Numbers Restaurant,1,2017-07-08,"We came to this place attracted by BlogTO's boast of the best lasagna in town. What's a better way to try the place then the Family Meal it has on the menu. For a set price you get to try a little bit of all their well known food.

It comes with appetizers, salads, pasta, and a main course to share.  With all the rave reviews, we thought we were going to have the best meal of our lives.

To note: Their Lasagna was pretty good. It comes in the menu as a small for just under $10 or a bigger pasta size.  I will return just for that.

Everything else, my companion and I were pretty disappointed.  Granted, it should be pretty hard to screw up a salad. Most is just compilation of freshly chopped up raw ingredients.  One of the salads was dressed REALLY sour.  I ended up taking it home and tossing it with more raw vegetables to be palatable.

The pasta sampler plate they provided came with 3 pasta of their choices - this included the legendary lasagna.  It was the ONLY good thing on the plate. One of the pasta was undercooked so it was still crunchy. We had to send it back to be more ""al dente.""

The only control of choice you have was the main dish. We were able to each choose 2 mains individually -  a pork chop and a lamb shank.  That being the highlight of the meal, we were both pretty disappointed too.  The pork chop was way overcook and tough. The lamb shank - well...we had better elsewhere.

We expected a lot more going into the restaurant especially paying over $100 including wine. We both agree afterwards we should had just gotten a lasagna and that's it.

This place was not horrendous but I would not go out of my way to return.",0
Stelvio,3,2018-09-25,"Queen West small Italian shop with simple black and white décor, sizeable patio but limited seating inside, typical (you'll get the joke soon) Italian fair with a slight focus on risottos and pastas.

I thought just the décor was black and white, but it turned out the placemats and menus were also black and white - there's a collection of black ink art that reminds me of medieval times when artists worked for months on a simple line drawing to get things just right - whether it was embellishment in a single capital letter, or a decorative flower, or the skull of an animal - because you know, all these are completely related and belong side by side. Nothing wrong with it at all, it was definitely unique and presented artfully. 

The menu is deceptively lengthy - dishes are in Italian then described in English. I've never read a menu that uses ""typical"" as it's adjective of choice so much. Most of my party went for pastas - they were smaller portions than desired. It would've been fine as a lunch portion, but for dinner it was insufficient and taste was simpler than expected (or should I say, typical?). The risotto with veal was actually a highlight despite some other reviews and the portion was actually filling, unlike the gnocchi and ravioli items (those were the smallest!). Overall it was really not bad - but unfortunately underwhelming.

Service is very slow if you're a large group - so please spare them and only come with a few friends. You'll enjoy the ambiance more and sharing more items will be more feasible, and your overall experience will just be that much better! If I'm in the area I suppose I could give it another shot, but for one that values taste over aesthetic, I might not be back.",1
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill,3,2019-05-29,"I did not choose this place myself, but a friend had reservations for our group of friends on a Saturday night. Waited about 20 minutes to be seated. It is a pretty cozy place and very packed, but I assumed that meant it was delicious too! I thought the food was much too overpriced for the portions. I chose the angel hair pasta and it just tasted like something you whip up at home for a quick meal. I admit I should have just chosen something else with more flavor, but the prices were stopping me. 
I did really enjoy the calamari salad though. It was flavorful and perfectly grilled. Delicious. 
I have to note that it was super chilly inside to the point where my teeth were chattering at the end of our meal. 
I would like to come back to try a different dish though!",1
La Marquesita,4,2019-09-04,"I ordered the pulled pork Campechano Torta which was on special through Ritual eats. It's sort of like a taco one a sandwich was interesting to try. The bread is toasted till it's crunchy which helps prevent it from getting soggy from the salsa's and sauces. The meat was tender and came in a good quantity. One of the salsas was a bit overpowering compared to everything else, but otherwise the sandwich meshed well. Not sure if I would pay full price, since it didn't come with a side chips or anything like that, but as a one off meal I definitely enjoyed it.",2
Carisma,1,2019-07-04,"Disappointed. 
Good service but not so good food. The pasta was so tough to the point of being uncooked!  the bread was good.",0
Byblos,5,2019-02-17,"Contemporary classic lounge fitting for a modern Mediterranean meal. 

Service: The memory of our server was amazing, and she offered some great suggestions for our meal. Had our order down, including the right additions and substitutions without having to write anything down. Was always topping up our water, and the servers cleared our plates/replaced them when they were dirty. Each and every dish was explained to us.

Food: The lamb ribs were fragrant with the scent of sesame and very tender, definitely a must-get. Manti dumplings were interesting, but not a fan of the yogurt sauce. Pide was also delicious, but the cheese masked most of the truffle flavour. Wagyu was cooked perfectly, and the onion and black garlic complimented it very well. Would also get the short rib kebab again and the signature dish from day one the restaurant opened, the roasted lamb shoulder. Topped everything off with a delicious burnt honey ice cream, a perfect ending to the rich experience.

Overall: Dishes were perfectly balanced and seasoned well with Mediterranean spices and flavours - perfect for sharing, although a bit pricey for the portion sizes. Modern take on traditional dishes served in a tapas format.

Tip: Ask for seating upstairs for a more intimate/classy lounge (more dimly lit), main floor seating for a more formal dining experience. Reserve early, as spots get taken up quickly!",2
Itacate,3,2018-10-18,"Were the tacos good? Definitely. Pescado, beef and pork with pineapple, all solid choices with two homemade tortillas each. 

The people were pleasant, though not overly friendly. 

Its cash only, that in my book makes things difficult. 

The wait is long, I had to wait (I was told) 25-30 mins for three tacos. To me they just need to sort out their process to get through orders faster. I understand you have one big order before me and you want to be authentic, but there must be efficiencies.

Maybe if you offered like chips while I wait it would smooth things out for me.

It's delicious and authentic like I said, but not sure I'd wait another 30 mins for tacos.",1
7 Numbers Restaurant,2,2016-05-02,"Tasty food, but a bit of a disappointment.

I booked a big party for my brother's birthday people. They were incredible about this, they kept in communication with me and were actually able to accommodate 26 adults and 6 babies with a week's notice, which grew to 32 adults, then shrunk back to 26 once we got there. Flakiness. 

We all had the $34 prix fixe, which meant three apps and three pastas shared family style and an individual entree dish. I was sitting at a table with 11 other people, and we didn't get enough food. Each of the sharing dishes was a dinner plate size, shared across all 12 of us, leaving everyone with literally 2 soup spoons full of each item. This was a huge surprise to me as I've eaten at the Danforth location with the same sort of setup - big party, shared plates, except we had the same size of dish for 4 people. 

The other tables in our party (table of maybe 8 adults and 4 kids, and another table with 5 adults and two kids) got the same amount of food, and they were pretty stuffed. We ended up asking for a second portion of the pasta, because it really was a very small amount of food per person, especially considering the price of the meal. The server balked at this, but gave us another serving, which was devoured in a second. 

The food itself was very good (though the osso buco was a bit bland), and for the most part, the service was great, but unfortunately the dinner ended with a table of adults who were still hungry.",0
Wilbur Mexicana,5,2019-09-03,"Since my first Wilbur visit I have ventured back my times and each better then the last!

The Fajitas in general are outstanding and at 18$ they make for good value too considering you can share easily

Ohhh and chips with Guac are a must!

........me encanta.",2
Tacos El Asador,2,2020-06-02,"The service was amazing, the guy that greeted us especially was very enthusiastic. But .. when it came from the food. it was definitely 1/5. No flavour , no seasoning no nothing. We ordered 6 Tacos, Guac and chips and cheese Pupusas . To begin with the tacos lets just say we didn't eat them all. The shrimp tasted too.. fishy? not enough toppings on the taco. The beef was blend and so was the chicken. Only good thing about our order was the guac and chips. I normally go to taco Gus at Kensington (highly recommend ) and I regret trying something new.",0
La Chingada,5,2019-10-13,"I live in Chicago and I'm spoiled with delicious Mexican food, so this place blew my mind. 

The sauces are amazing. If they sold them I would've brought a few bottles back with me. I had the taco bowl with chorizo and the choriqueso.  Both were beyond amazing. The chorizo is the best chorizo I ever had in my life.",2
El Catrin Destileria,3,2020-01-14,"Guacamole was good but portions are not that big. The price of dishes are fine. Atmosphere was very nice. For the desert we had churros with chocolate and caramel sauce and they had really good taste and texture. We did waited some extra time for service and we shouldn't, because at that time restaurant wasn't to busy.. No free parking.",1
Como En Casa,3,2019-07-07,"Rating: 3/5

Summary: 
We believe this restaurant is worth a visit if in the area. We have frequented this place multiple times and there is a reason we keep coming back. The service is extremely friendly and the atmosphere, though tight, is rather warm and welcoming. However, one must be careful when picking their dish because while some taste wonderfully flavorful, others are somewhat disappointing.

The dishes we tried: 
- burrito w/ verde sauce
- fish tacos
- chicken enchiladas
- chicken mole
- guac/salsa w/ chips
- mains circa $12-15
- appetizers circa $6-8

Food:
One of our favorite dishes is the Burrito with Verde Sauce. It's a big hot burrito packed with many flavors. What makes it special, however, is the verde sauce that complements the burrito very well. The verde sauce is a tangy and spicy sauce that consists of tomatillos, jalapenos, and lime. You probably won't get burritos smothered with a delicious sauce at other places where you'd think of getting a burrito (Chipotle, etc.). We'd also point out that the Guacamole tastes extremely fresh with a great rich and creamy feel. The chunky and spicy salsa is also great. The two dipping sauces pair well with the tortilla chips and is worth considering if looking for an appetizer.

However, we were disappointed with some of the dishes we ordered. For example, the enchiladas and chicken mole did not satisfy at all. As for the enchiladas, the ones we had were filled with extremely dry chicken and the wrap itself was also unappetizing.

On a positive note, the service is remarkable. The owner once even gave us a free refill for our horchata (a most delightful sweet drink consisting of rice, vanilla, and cinnamon). The servers are very kind and patient, thus contributing to a better dining experience.

Conclusion: 
Google reviews rates this as a 4.5/5. We give it a 3/5. It's worth a visit if in the area, but there are only certain dishes worth eating. We recommend the chicken or burrito with verde sauce and the horchata.

Los Guaca-Moles,1,2019-06-01,"II really, really wanted to just love this place and sorry about the loooong review (i am normally not one to have such an extended view) BUT I made two mistakes today:

1) Cancelling my reservation at Playa Cabana ( the last 5:00 pm spot) to go to this restaurant (SMH)
2) The place is supposed to open at 5,like a dumbass I actually waited until 5:20 when they finally decided they felt like opening.

That kind of slackness will get your business shut down in Toronto, with sooooooooooo many good places to go and eat all within blocks who the hell is really gonna stick around and wait for places to open past the time they should be??? ....ohhhhhhhhh the regret folks.   

When I walked in ,there were only two other people seated ( who also decided to sit outside and wait saw them earlier)..hmm wonder if they too had regret, but anyways onto the experience. Walked in and there was a bartender and 1 person sitting at the bar. So we seat ourselves at the front of the restaurant and it literally took the guy behind the bar 10 min. to finally put down some menus, he goes back to the bar chitty chatty with the guy sitting at the bar another 10 min goes by he  comes back to take the order. We order drinks and food (Sabinita-- layers of refried black beans, cheese, sour cream & guacamole, Poblanito -soft tortilla; mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds) and two Pescado- mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds). 

Slowly two of the wait staff make their way in and the guy behind the bar says something in spanish possibly about being late who knows seems to be the trend here, and then another table of patrons come in and than another the wait staff all of two seem confused and dazed. The Sabinita comes to to the table and I ask the waiter if our drinks are coming he says he doesn't know, 5 min later the rest of the order comes out I ask again about the drinks another guy comes over with a menu I said no I ordered them when I first sat down? Repeated the order ( like really the bartender couldn't remember to send out the friggin drinks when at the time there was a total of 4ppl in the place (I could just imagine if there were more than 12 ppl in this place it would be like chaos to remember OMG all these drinks OMG ....seriously its like amateure night in here).

 He comes back minutes later with the drinks, in all fairness not his fault he didn't take the order initially nor was he the  DUH guy that said didn't know when the drinks were coming, and that is the last time we saw anyone come over,no one came by to check on the table to see if everything was good ( which it was NOT) and the place was not busy 4 tables occupied does not constitute as busy.   

 The Poblanito was just ok , the fish tacos were downright dreadful they were breaded in some sort of cornmeal which  was not an issue but the fish they used had a gelatinous texture and honestly there wasn't a dash of seasoning in the coating or the fish itself  not even the toppings were seasoned. IT WAS BLAND  i could barely get through it so so i doused it with hot sauce and still it stank (tastewise) so I only ate the one left the other one on the plate and covered it with my napkin (RIP).

 So now all I have left is half a beer which i'm chugging so I can get the hell outta there!! I indicate to the waiter that we're ready to leave and the bill arrives and he asked how was it ?  I was blunt, honest said it was terrible he was concerned surprised and wanted specifics, so I went off about the fish he said he would go and let the the guy in the back know ,  I said really you don't have to but off he went came back apologised. I said I guess that is just how its done here the only redeeming thing about this whole meal was the Sabinita & the beer.

 Sad to say but  I'm not one to give 2nd chances when it comes to food & service like I said this city is a ""Food Mecca"" too many other places to go and try, so bottom line I would never venture back to this place, I would rather take my $$ and go around the corner to Barrio Coreano or Tacos El Asador where the service and food at least in my experiences have been consistently great .",0
Nodo Restaurant,5,2018-06-24,"The "" U Chiurito"" pizza will be the reason I return to Nodo. After visiting Sicily last summer, pistachio on pizza was something I constantly came across, so to find this in Toronto was more than I could have ever hoped for!

The texture of the Brussels sprouts along with the cheese, pistachio and arugula pesto make this pizza fresh, meaty (without meat!) and eating every last bite. The warm olives, the burrata, the coccoli - this place does not disappoint.

Service, ambiance, food are all on point at both locations. I would highly recommend it!",2
Juicy Dumpling,5,2019-12-03,"Food: 5
Price: $
Interior: 4


We had lunch at another fancier restaurant in the area - Asian Legend and ordered the crab pork dumplings, that is incomparable to crab pork dumplings served in Juicy Dumpling - the fast food place here.

The crab and pork dumplings here are soooo delicious, and at very affordable price point.

We ordered a regular pork dumpling ($3) and a crab+pork dumpling ($6), both are very juicy, and extremely delicious.. comparable to the ones we had in China, or New York's Spring Deer Restaurant.

Wished I had more room in my tummy to get more of it.

This place deserves a Michellin recommendation.",2
Noodle King,5,2018-07-26,"Well, damn. This place is just too good to be stuck in a dimly lit food court with a dimly lit sign in the middle of almost nowhere.

Of course, I've had it bookmarked for a pretty long time after seeing the outstanding reviews, but it took stumbling upon it by accident while getting lost in the PATH to actually try it out. Definitely one of the best hidden gems I've ever been to! The noodles are absolutely delicious, and the broth was so savoury I literally gulped it down. The shrimp wontons? Huge! I was really surprised to see the enormous pieces of shrimp packed in them. The vegetables were super fresh too - no wilted leaves here! And nothing tasted like the artificial or over-seasoned MSG filled stuff you might expect at a food court (or elsewhere). Can this place open up other locations already??? I think it can give even some of the popular restaurants uptown a run for their money. :P

Can I also just say again, bless you Yelp, you're doing great work :D",2
Grazie Ristorante,1,2020-03-05,We arrived at 9:34 pm two times and they didn't let us to be seat because kitchen is closed. Operation hours indicated til 10 pm and they blocked customer come in 30mins before that doesn't make sense.,0
Enoteca Sociale,5,2019-05-23,"This place is probably a 4.5, but I'm rounding-up because I think this place needs some love from the 4 stars it currently has. 

I was flying solo and grabbed a seat at the bar, and the bartender was really helpful. Although solo, I could tell this was wonderful date restaurant as it was rather intimate. But fret not, even though I was solo, the restaurant wasn't that 'date-y' and it was lively and social(e) so it's still good for small groups. 

I only ordered 2 small plates to get a sense of the restaurant, and I was really impressed. I ordered the arancini and the rapini, and both were delicious. 

The arancini was one of the better ones I've had and that's saying something, because I have had some delicious arancini. The ones served at Enoteca Sociale had great texture, and wonderful combination of the crunchy outer crust and the soft cheese and rice inside were perfect. It was a perfect ratio of rice, cheese, and fried breading. 

The rapini was also very flavorful and had a nice level of oil and acid. They keep it in long strips and so it was rather difficult to cut with a butter knife, but that was the only drawback of 2 delicious dishes. 

Although a small sampling, I was impressed and definitely want to get back to try some of their main dishes and entrees. I can't speak to those dishes, but I can point you in the direction of some of their starters. Definitely recommend those dishes!",2
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3,2020-02-21,"It was alright. Went in here for lunch service and ordered the Khao soi.  I knew all the hype surrounding this restaurant. 

To be honest I don't understand why they are awarded with such accolades I stayed in Thailand for a month so I will use that for comparison. 

I find the Khao soi too rich and coconutty. It over takes the subtle nuances of a balanced dish. It just taste like coconut cream soup. I wouldn't make this the quintessential place for Thai food. Support other local businesses.",1
House of Gourmet,1,2019-11-23,"Terrible service. Despite seeing my party, they continued to ignore us until we stopped them while they were walking by us. Food was cold and did not taste good at all. Highly do not recommend.",0
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill,4,2019-07-20,"We sat at the patio which has great street view and perfect for summer. But be aware that you can't order drinks if sitting outside.

My girlfriend and I shared calamari and seafood pasta. The calamari wasn't the fried ones as I thought, but still yum, tender and juicy. The seafood pasta had shrimp and mussel was great too, love the tomato sauce they made.

The waiter constantly checked our table and added water, great service.

Overall great dining experience.",2
Homemade Ramen,2,2019-09-28,This was just okay for me. There are so many hand pulled noodle places in Toronto now that I'm not sure this really stands out. They have generous noodle portions but not so many veggies. Meat was all right. I think my big mistake was getting the chicken wings which turned out being tasteless and with breading similar but (not as flavorful) as KFC. Oh well. On to the next place.,0
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2019-08-20,"Found this on Yelp and picked it cause it had a higher rating than the other shops all lined up serving the same thing!

There were only a few people in line for Ho Ho, but there was a line out the door a few shops down. Probably should've gone to the other place, but this one was ok.

Pork was ok. The skin was still crispy when we got back to the hotel. Duck wasn't anything special. Cha siu was ok. This w all about average for us, although I know our moms would say it wasn't good.

Next time, I'll have to try the other place with the longer line.",1
Artisan Plus,3,2019-08-23,"Another month has come and gone and here we are in the heart of Toronto just doing our thing. We've walked by Artisan Plus many time and we finally gave it a try. This place was buzzing with people around the lunch hour however the wait for a table for two wasn't very long. We waited may be 5 mins.

As this was our first visit we wanted to try a few of the appetizers and different noodles dishes. As such for the apps, we ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo which is handcraft artisan bread with chopped braised pork belly and gravy. The braised pork belly was quite tasty however it did get quite messy because of the gravy. We also tried the Shuan Tofu Sheet which was made of fresh tofu sheet mixed with bean sprouts, shredded red pepper, scallion, gourmet chilli, peanut and sesame sauce. This dish had the very slightest numbing spice. However this dish was slightly on the oily side and the tofu sheet were too long.

For our mains, I tried the Famous Yo Po Biang Mian which was ribbon noodle, sauteed tomato, scramble egg, cauliflower, potato, carrot, organic cloud ear mushroom, edamame, grilled zucchini, paparika, and vinegrette. The ribbon noodle was super long which made eating the noodle slightly difficult. However the flavours were different and interesting. Nothing that really made my taste buds dance. There was no numbing spice to this dish. However if you don't eat spicy on a regular basis I wouldn't recommend this dish. My husband tried the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. Surprisingly the Lamb wasn't super gamey. Again the noodles were all super long and the flavour was okay. However, I still want to try their noodle soup one day. 

The service was on the ball. The waitress was always around in case you needed them. Than again the restaurant wasn't super large. There were probably around 40 seats.",1
Asian Legend,4,2019-10-19,"This is a really great place for authentic Chinese food! I've ordered a variety of their foods, from xiao long bao to hot and sour soup to Peking duck. All of it is delicious, it's not the best Chinese food I've ever had but it's pretty darn good and hits the spot.

The atmosphere is great, clean and modern. It looks like a high-end restaurant, but the prices are very reasonable!

Service is generally good, but it kind of depends on the day. That's the only reason I'm holding back from 5 stars.",2
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,1,2018-11-13,It was way over priced for the type of food you get. One particular waiter was very rude (Tony). The other waiters were polite but the ratio of wait staff to patrons was not balanced. We had trouble just getting water or trying to get our bill.,0
Grazie Ristorante,3,2019-03-09,"We came to Grazie for dinner on a Friday evening. It was half empty when we came in (around 4:45), but it was packed by 6pm. Honestly, I expected food to be better based on all the reviews, however it wasn't spectacular food! Service was fine (when it wasn't busy), ambience was traditional but very noisy (perhaps because restaurant is small and packed with people). 

I don't know if I'll return to try again as would like to explore other restaurants around.",1
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,3,2019-04-19,"Well, this was a good place to me after the owner said I have to pay 10% tip? 

This is not a full service restaurant, I actually had to go to the cashier to pay my bill so I wouldn't understand why I have to pay 10%?

My bill was 37.32 and I have her $40，and I asked her kept the changes and she said it's not enough? 
It's totally ridiculous! I wouldn't care if the food good or not. It's really pricey as well.",1
House of Gourmet,1,2019-05-27,"This is my first and last time trying this place, here is why:
1. Service: I get it, lots of people come here for food, lineup is long, and not that many waiters, but when I was trying to order food, the server was literally so impatient that he kept tapping his fingers on the table loudly, I spent like 2 minutes thinking and he made me feel like I was wasting his time. This is a big NONO for me.
2. The rice noodle roll around fried dough炸两肠粉: for all the people on yelp who recommended it, I really think u should try more places for this before recommendation. I have never seen people put it in soy sauce, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CRISPY and u put it in liquid, what is the common sense here? And the bottom layer of it was so soggy I didn't even know what I was eatin, mush or food. Then I took a bite of the top layer rolls which did not touch any of the sauce, the fried dough was so soggy and soft and then I suddenly understood why they had to put sauce on it ---- to cover the fact that they don't even know how to make this dish. DO NOT ORDER.
3. Two meat combo rice - roasted pork and roasted duck. When we asked them about the roasted pork, waiter said ""it's crispy"", it WAS 100% NOT CRISPY. I don't understand how do they expect people to pay for dishes with this low quality, I really don't get it.

I can find at least 3 restaurants which costs much less in Chinatown and still beats this place in every aspects, so if I were u, I would avoid it for life.",0
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,4,2020-01-30,"Knowing where to get the best tacos in town is serious business. As it stands, the best tacos that I have ever eaten have been at Tacofino in Tofino and Tres Carnales Taquería in Edmonton. After reading that Seven Lives was voted #1 Best Taco 2018 by NOW Toronto, named in National Geographic magazine's Places of a Lifetime article, and called #1 Best Fish Taco and #1 Best Tacos by blogTO... They seemed like a sure bet.

You'll find Seven Lives located in Kensington Market, one of the most eclectic corners of the city which suits them well. I visited the tiny shop on a Friday evening, prior to their early closing time of 7pm. They're definitely more of a lunch or early dinner type of place. It should also be noted that they accept cash only, so come prepared!

The tiny shop is bustling and exciting, buzzing with taco energy. The bright walls and giant sign that reads ""TACOS"" sets the vibe perfectly. I also appreciate their logo of a cat with a fish in its mouth - and the insinuation that this cat is down to seven lives, having already lost two. There is one table that can seat about four people and then there's a little bit of standing-room-only counter space. This makes things a little bit awkward if you plan to eat-in, as I did. The table wasn't available and so I stood at the counter in front of the window to eat instead. Which was fine. But certainly not ideal.

The menu is fairly straight forward, including nine types of tacos, some sides, and some beverages. Your order is placed at the counter with a friendly staff member and they call out your name once the food is ready.

Starting with something to drink, I was happy to see Agua de Jamaica on the menu. I always prefer an agua fresca when visiting a Mexican establishment, although I was also happy to see that Jarritos Mexican sodas are also on offer. (Their cola is my personal favourite of all of the colas.) Agua de Jamaica, otherwise known as ""hibiscus water"" is a beverage that exists in several cultures. In Southeast Asia it is known as Rosella tea and it's basically the same thing. Tart and sweet, this refreshing drink was a perfect accompaniment to the food.

We decided to get a Side as a bit of an appetizer. Tortilla Chips (Made fresh! - $3.00) and Guacamole ($3.00 for small) seemed like the way to go. I was a bit surprised that the guacamole didn't just come with tortilla chips and that both items had to be purchased separately. However, I did enjoy the homemade nature of the chips and that a heaping amount of them are tossed into a brown paper bag and given to you. I'll take a bag of chips any day. Golden and ultra crispy, these tortilla chips are exactly what I wanted them to be. They were seasoned really nicely as well. The guacamole was fresh and bright, with a great acidic kick to it. Obviously chips and guac are a match made in heaven.

Next it was time for the big show: the TACOS. Of the nine tacos available, two of them (the Adobada and the Carnitas) were already sold out. On the plus side, I probably wouldn't have ordered either of these anyway. Although, I must say that this did not leave much for meat options. There were four fish/seafood tacos, one beef and one chicken option, and a vegetarian. Nothing for pork at all. But again, I did not mind at all because I was going full ocean food - it's what they specialize in, after all.

Baja Fish ($6.00) and Gobernador ($6.00) were the ones for me. I loved the little condiments bar to the left of the counter that featured three different salsas (hot habanero, medium tomatillo, mild guajillo) as well as chili oil with sesame, and a bowl of sliced limes. This makes it very easy to customize your tacos to your preferred specifications and to control the amount of heat that you desire.

The tacos did not take very long and before I knew it, a green plastic basket was placed in my hands. The tacos were certainly vibrant and demanding to be eaten.

I began with the Gobernador (smoked marlin, shrimp & cheese). If Seven Lives has a signature taco, this is the one. Their front window even says ""home of the Gobernador"" right on it. I definitely loved the smokiness from the marlin the most, while the shrimp filled out the taco and added more texture. Everything had been grilled up deliciously. The pickled onion brought a great hit of balancing flavour and I liked the fresh tortillas a lot.

Next I had the Baja Fish (fried haddock). The first thing that I noticed is how generous the portion of fish is! The haddock was big, juicy and fried to perfection. The rest of the taco was kept very fresh with cabbage and fresh homemade salsa on top.

Both tacos were packed full and were pretty messy to eat, but in the best possible way. I liked both tacos but found them to be missing something that I can't quite put my finger on. I guess that I was hoping for something even bigger and more unexpected in terms of flavour. They were good... Just not the best that I've ever had.

I was also very impressed to see a C",2
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,1,2019-12-24,"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant! 
The service was so slow; we got our food after exactly one hour. Also, the server didn't speak English, was aggressive, and had an attitude. 
Moreover, the food was served colder than usual and was extra oily. 
We tried to address the issue to the manager but he said: ""it's okay"".

Artisan Plus,3,2020-01-10,"What did I just eat? lol
I tried their Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian. It's a random mix of everything. It has a lot of vegetables (potato, mushrooms, carrots, zucchini, egg & tomato) if you want a healthier option. For me, it's not a lot of meat, a smaller portion and not very filling. The hand pulled noodles were good, the right texture, but again not enough quantity.",1
El Nahual Tacos,5,2020-02-10,"We were here with friends for dinner. I love variety and trying new things and they didn't disappoint.  We had the open face tacos and they created some really unique flavour combinations.

We tried one of 6 different open face tacos.  See my pictures. They were all delicious.  The 6 different ones were:
(1) Carrnitas. Braised pulled pork, pickled carrot.
(2) Al Pastor (mild). Marinated pork with dried chiles, spices and achote, onion, cilantro, grilled pineapple.
(3) Black Tiger Shrimp. Garlic crispy cheese on tortilla, onion, grilled peppers, cilantro, avocado salsa.
(4) Fried Fish. Cod marinated with oregano, cilantro, cabbage slaw, cilantro aioli.
(5) Pulled Beef Barbacoa (mild). Slow cooked spiced beef blade, cilantro, onion, avocado salsa.
(6) Chorizo (mild). House-made spiced pork, onion, cilantro, avocado salsa, wrapped in crispy mozzarella.

They had bottled drinks from Jarritos Canada.

Lai Wah Heen,2,2019-07-11,"First of all, let's be clear. Growing up in Asia, I have tasted the best of the best! So I'm not easily impressed by Chinese restaurants overseas. Lai Wah Heen came with rave reviews by Canadians, so I thought I'd check it out and see how it measured up to restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Verdict - Lai Wah Heen, which is supposedly 5-star here in Toronto, has dim sum that any 3-star restaurants in Singapore (eg. Mid-tier Wah Lok would win hands down) and Hong Kong can easily beat.

The presentation was nice. The taste profile of some of their offerings were decent, but there was only ONE stand-out dish that wowed - and that was the lava custard buns, which were flawlessly executed.

My biggest complaint was the skin on the steamed dumplings. The skin was too thick (especially the lobster dumpling) and chewing through it was laborious.

Overall, it's not worth the price.",0
Eataly,3,2020-03-11,"Eataly is located in the Manulife building but it has its own entrance (you have to walk past the Manulife building entrance) to see the Eataly one. If you go in the Manulife entrance, it's like a wild goose chase trying to find Eataly - there's no signage or direction anywhere. 

In general, Eataly is a nice concept for all things italian. The items are a little on the pricier side and you can get most items elsewhere for cheaper. But as my friend said, it's the Eataly experience.

There are a few restaurants (reservations recommended), counter type food stations, desserts, coffee, a bar, and a grocery store with meats, cheese, olives etc. 

I also think a lot of the produce products will end up in the garbage - you can see them starting to turn bad. Not sure if there is a large enough market for those products. 

Overall, it was a nice place to visit but the experience was just okay. It can get crowded with people everywhere just browsing. The food was just okay (we ate at La Pizza and La Pasta, and had a cannoli and a tiramisu after). I feel like I've had better Italian Food elsewhere. 

Come for the hype once and then spend your $$ elsewhere.",1
Khao San Road,3,2019-06-23,"Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Decor: 3/5
Price: 4/5

Small and quaint. When entering there was a sign warning about bugs that may look like cockroaches inside the restaurant. It says to not be alarmed they are not cockroaches and it is natural during the summer days for these little insects to find their way indoors. If spotted you can call a waiter to come by and they will sweep them up and take them outdoors. 

The menu's are suuuuper dirty. They do not wipe them down at all! There's tons of grit and its sticky on all 3 of our menu's. The pricing wasn't too clearly shown. For the main's its all the same price located at the very top $16.95 and then you can add on your different meats for a dollar or 2 on top. 

We got two appetizers the garlic shrimp and the fried chicken. They were both delicious!. For the mains the green curry was okay, we got it with beef. Big mistake, their beef is extremely tough! it was super dry, felt like it's been cooked for days and kept in the fridge to be warmed up in a microwave and tossed into the curry to serve. The 3 flavours pad thai was good. had a lot of flavour and ingredients as well. The best out of the 3 was the Khao Soi, i got that one with chicken. Delicious. No complaints. 

We let the waitress know about the really tough beef and she just took the dish and brought it to the kitchen without saying a word. After a few minutes she came back and said she would switch the curry to chicken instead. We agreed and she took the plate back inside. It was a pretty busy night so taking awhile for the food to come out is understandable. I shared the Khao Soi and waited for the green curry to come out. By the time we finished our food it finally came. We just asked for it to-go. 

The service i would say is about a 3.5, she seemed as though she was just rushing through everything without talking with the customers. Food took quite a while as well. I would go back to try their other menu items.",1
Agio,3,2018-12-12,"A difficult review to write... have had Agio bookmarked for a long time. 

Pitched it for my work lunch and because everyone trusted me Agio was booked. 

There were a few changes in numbers but the day before I did confirm 9 people with a birthday celebration. 

We arrive to a chilly empty restaurant at 12pm hungry and ready to try delicious pasta. 

We sit and ariund 1215pm i order calamari, trio bruschetta and cauliflower fritters to start. Half of us were there and the other half trickled in. The latest person arrive and we order entrees around 1240pm. 

At 115pm is when we first start to get appetizers. The friendly owner was the only one taking care of tables and cooking. 

Our entrees came around 145pm. The difficulty is that not everyone has a 2 hour lunch. The birthday girl ended up having to leave with no entree just apps because she had an appointment at 2pm. 

We finally wrapped up the meal around 215 with creme brulee on the house, the owner made it specifically for us the might before. 

I liked the apps, amuse bouche of squash stuff grilled zucchini. My spicy tomato spaghetti was delicious and pasta was fresh. 

The chef reminded us this several times that his food is made fresh. 

We ended up being the only table the whole time, off the lunch menu the meatballs werent available and half the table didnt love their entrees. Not 4.5 stars love anyways. 

Disappointing because I felt like the chef should have had someone come in to help or tell us the calamari cant be ordered becausr of the work behind it. Turned out chewy which was unfortunate. 

Just wish there was more communication. It was quite embarrassing for me to be responsible for a mediocre hangry people filled lunch :(

I was still defending the restaurant the next week... ill go back to try with a smaller group. 

It does have character I just don't think it was a good mix for a large group that didn't have 2.5 hrs for lunch.",1
Xola Mexican Food,2,2017-02-24,"Xola Mexican Food would be a great cosy place to take a first date. They promise Mexican food unlike any other. The small setting is endearing. While the service was excellent, and the menu promised good, fresh ingredients...

No salsa or chips to get you started on the house as is usual in the places I've been. Instead, for $10.50 or so, when we ordered the Guacamole as an appetizer, it was excellent and enough for both of us. As good as avocados can be. Not special.

I ordered the Duck. I received a very small serving roast duck taken off the bone in a small bowl, several small wraps, a  1/2 ramekin of chopped fruit for the wrap, a  1/2 ramekin of sour cream. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. Messy.  It was OK. Not interesting. Cost over $22.00.

My girlfriend ordered braised Lamb. Same thing. It was a tiny portion, stewed and served in a small bowl, with several small wraps,  1/2 ramekin of black beans. That's it. No potatoes. No rice. No salad. It was just OK. The duck was better. Cost over $18.00.

Add 1 beer and 1 excellent Margarita to that, and the bill was $80. 

Because the service was good, a tip had to be added which brought it up to $90.

Moral to this story - Xola is not even close to worth it. You won't find what you're used to or expect to. If you're open to novelty, you'll be disappointed by what you're served and what you're not.

For the best mexican, its worth the trip to Cielito Lindo in Pickering or Mexican Lindo at 971 O'Connor Dr, Toronto  - the very best. And we could have eaten twice for what I paid.

If you want duck or lamb, better to hit Chinatown or Greek Town respectively.",0
Miku,2,2019-12-10,"I wanted sooo badly to love Miku ...Because of the high ratings and I being a major sushi lover, I had very high expectations for this place. My overall experience was extremely underwhelming and disappointing.. The quality of the food is definitely not worth the price.

We ordered the anniversary prix fixe, signature sushi selection platter, beef carpaccio and tuna tartare. The prix fixe was OK.. quantity wise this one is actually worth the price as you get a lot of courses, but only the sashimi stood out as it was delicious and so fresh that it melted in my mouth! The sashimi is my favourite dish out of the ENTIRE meal... none of our other dishes stood out at all.. they did not taste fresh and to be honest, very bland. The beef carpaccio had barely any sauce on it but for some reason, had such a strong and weird after taste that my partner only managed 2 bites LOL. I've dined at many sushi restaurants and have had way better quality and fresh sushi for less than half the price at Miku..

Service was pretty good. Our server was very sweet, made sure our waters were always filled and checked up on us a few times. It was just a bit hard to understand her when she was explaining the food items due to her accent but its not too big of a deal.. 

I don't recommend and don't plan to return to Miku... so much better sushi out there at a far better price.",0
98 Aroma,1,2019-04-07,"If I was able to give 0 stars, I would. This is probably the worst restaurant I've eaten at. 

We ordered 5 dishes, 4 of which were completely inedible.
- Traditional pancake: This was our first dish and was fairly tasty. No complaints here. This was the only redeeming part of the experience.
- Green beans with minced meat: It was too salty and too oily. 
- Kungpow shrimp: This is absurdly greasy and spicy which left our tongues numb. 
- Fried rice with pineapple and seafood: In contrast to the previous two dishes that were over-spiced, this was tasteless and (surprise surprise) oily as heck. 
- Lobster with ginger and scallion: This was the most pathetic dish of them all. We were served either a baby lobster that had not yet developed any meat, or they somehow threw out half of the lobster before plating it. On top of this, it did not taste fresh.

Sometimes terrible food can be saved by good service. Nope, not today unfortunately. The waiters were amateur (pleasant, and well-meaning but did not know what they were doing). They gave us a dirty fork, and when we alerted them to it, they took it away then brought it back and said ""we washed it for you"". 

You might look at my profile picture and judge me for being a clueless white guy. I went with a group of 3 other Chinese people who know food well, and we were all appalled at how this restaurant is even open for business.",0
La Marquesita,5,2019-02-18,"Hi, i went to eat lunch here today with my friends and i had a wonderful experience. The space is so clean and beautiful. The food is the best mexican food in toronto. So much variety in their menu. They also have their signature desert. The price is very good too.i am coning back only here for mexican food. The staff is so friendly and fast",2
Trattoria Nervosa,2,2019-11-11,"Unfortunately they did not let us make reservations probably because of the small size of the restaurant. 

I had a really uncomfortable time at this restaurant... let me tell you why...

The seating arrangement of the tables was very poor. 

We were seated on the second floor at a small table. There was another table, located one foot away from us, between us and the wall/window. Directly behind my friends seat was another table, so when she sat down, her chair was almost touching this other table. Directly behind my chair was someone else's chair. We were squished!!

When I sat down my chair was back to back with their chair. There was no room for the people in the table at the window to get out and for the servers to get over to them, so my friend and I had to stand up and tuck our chair in to let them through. When another couple came and sat there, I also had to stand up again and push my chair in to let them through. This was incredibly uncomfortable. 

A restaurant is supposed to be a relaxing place, especially when you are spending hard working money. I shouldn't be standing up and needing to let people through time and time again.

When serving the table behind me, the server had to squeeze behind my chair and stand right against the back and the side of my chair. It was not a relaxing dining experience at all! Service was okay at best, when they weren't getting me to stand up or squish us.

I ordered the malfalde ai fungi, it tasted delicious for the first few bites but the cream was so rich it was difficult to finish and I felt a little nauseous at the end. 

I expected much better!",0
Chop Chop,3,2018-11-10,"I give this place 3.5 stars.

This little neighbourhood hole-in-the-wall is one major black west of Chinatown proper. I like the industrial minimalist decor and the open-concept kitchen - which means you can hear the comforting sounds of food being prepared and cooked.

The menu is simple - not the 10-page ones you get at the authentic Chinese restaurants like Asian Legend. It seems they've decided just to focus on the crowd-pleaser items.

We ordered the chilli fish and the beef noodle soup. Both dishes came to the table piping hot. The chilli fish is a medium-sized plate of lightly battered, small fish fillets with a nice kick - I give it 4 stars. The beef noodle soup is a big bowl filled with (mostly) tender pieces beef, thick spaghetti-like noodles, what looked like bak choy and broth that also has a kick - I give it 3.5 stars.

The young wait staff seem eager - which is good. (Perhaps some of the more authentic Chinese restaurants like Kwan - at Yonge-St. Clair -  should have some of their waiters get pointers from Chop Chop.)

I would go back for the chilli fish.",1
La Vecchia Ristorante,1,2017-02-04,"I live in the Yonge/ Egg area and always heard this was supposed to be the best place on Yonge for food as the neighbourhood is quite lacking in the food area to begin with. 

I had high hopes for this restaurant but was gravely disappointed with the service and the food. The flavours they have are all wrong. Most of the food was very pungent and did not have a smooth flow of flavours. It was rather sour the risotto we ordered. We also ordered prawns and the sauces they chose were sour and pungent with too much salt. ( it's all in the sauce for Italian dishes). 

The Gnocchi was okay, it tasted like the Costco brand in a cream sauce ( who could mess up a cream sauce tbh) anyhow I am very disappointed. I did not find the food appetizing at all. The flavours were all mixed up and not great on the palette. 

My waiter unfortunately was very short tempered and seemed agitated the whole time whilst serving my family and I. Whenever we did need something he was never available and would rush off before we finished speaking with him. 

Anyway sad to have to review it like this but that is truly my opinion. 

No match to Campagnolo on Dundas or Buca",0
La Chilaca Taqueria,5,2019-08-28,"Honestly one of the most delicious taco joint ever!! Huge size Al pastor steak burrito is just $9.05 including tax. Even tho it's not wrapped up with rice, but it's densely packed with black beans, cheese, meat, pepper, onions, and your choice of salsa. They have 5 different salsa with different spicy level, and I choose to mix the 2 most spicy one together. The staff were super nice, it's honestly a hidden gem in Kensington market, I loved it so much.

Magical Taste of China,2,2020-01-27,"I came here with a group of friends and I have to say I wasn't very impressed.

It took us a long time to even get enough menus that we could share. The menus are confusing as there is a large place-mat like sheet you can use, or the menu book with pictures.

Then they tried to sell us a membership. Really? A membership? When I looked at the menu again there are 2 different prices. The cheaper one is the membership price and is of course brighter and more prominent than the higher non-member price. 

We ordered a variety of items and they were all meh. A few items we had to ask for again as they were forgotten. 

The staff run around yelling at each other and its really annoying and disturbing. 

When we finished and tried to pay, the waiter tried to split our bill and half way through asking each of us what we ordered he gave up and gave it to another server, so we had to start over again.

I wouldn't go again unless I went with someone with one of these fancy memberships.",0
El Charro,5,2020-03-05,"This place is authentic (in my non mexican opinion) and damn good. I like the creepy washrooms in the basement that add to the ""hole in the wall"" feeling of this restaurant. I think three tacos for 10$ is a good deal. The Mexican sausage and steak were delicious as they had these little pieces of juicy fat. They have different levels of spicy sauces yummm.",2
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,1,2018-01-14,"Worst Chinese food ever. It's places like this that give Chinese food a bad name. Threw out 75% of our order. 

Ordered what I thought would be staple Cantonese dishes that any decent place would find hard to screw up. Well guess what, Ha Gow managed to do just that. The seafood fried noodles were capital B bland - would it have hurt them to put even one drop of soy sauce? They also used cheap shrimp and squid that had no flavour. We also ordered the fried shrimp with spicy salt. This is honestly the most basic Cantonese dish (equivalent to fries for a Canadian restaurant). Well what came were those cheap shrimps they used for the noodles but smothered in a thick batter (they looked like balls of grease). Each bite oozed with grease and didn't taste like shrimp at all.

The other dishes ordered were equally bad. Seafood dumpling (all it tasted of was MSG), steamed squid in ginger and onion (think rubber bands laced with MSG), and shrimp rolls (no flavour). The spinach & shrimp dumpling was the only thing decent item. 

Avoid, avoid, avoid.",0
DaiLo,4,2019-11-26,"We came here for a date night and was blown away by the service and the food. I walked in thinking it was just every Asian fusion tapas restaurant but was pleasantly surprised with each dish.

To keep things interesting, we had the tasting menu and had dishes that weren't on the menu like the Big Mac Bao - which was delicious and you know, tasted like a Big Mac with that sauce.

My favorites of the night were the Hakka Wontons, Ontario Pea Dumplings and oddly enough, the corn soup starter they gave us to kick off the meal. 

I was completely stuffed at the end until the manager came over and served us a White Rabbit Ice Cream in basically a bowl of chocolate goodness. I will actually come back just for that dessert if it was on the menu - I was mind blown.

The only thing I would change is that instead of ordering the Giggling Trout, get the Duck instead.",2
Gusto 101,5,2019-09-15,"Go for the Gusto! Superb service, great ambiance and fantastic food. 
Planned a small surprise birthday dinner for my sister. She listed this as one of her favourite eateries in the city so I arrived early with balloons. 
The front entrance staff were very kind to allow me to get a table for four ...with balloons LOL. 
Wait staff were equally friendly and very fast. Service was excellent. 
Food: my sister highly enjoys their kale salad. I thought it was great - massaged kale shredded with some sort of lemon vinaigrette and topped with Parmesan shavings. 
I spied the pizzas making their way to the tables of others so I went with a  prosciutto and arugula option. It was delicious. Perfect combination of flavours with a light, crispy crust. 

Definitely recommend for a nice, light meal with friends. A little loud for a date night but groups seem to like it (there's a second level and a patio during the summer months).",2
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,3,2018-07-19,"Was here to celebrate my bestfriend's birthday. To start of with the service, I thought it was ok..we always had to ask for water refills. I didn't feel that the service was upscale enough for such a sophisticated, classy Italian restaurant.

Our server was knowledgeable and he made some recommendations. He suggested our party to order the Antipasto Gordonia ($24.95 pp) to share as we were all seafood lovers. I enjoyed the grilled calamari and tiger shrimps but everything else on that platter was mediocre. In terms of main, I ordered the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara ($22.95). The texture of the pasta was cooked to perfect al dente which I love. Flavour was rich but a bit too salty for my liking. My other friend who ordered a tomato based sauce mentioned her dish tasted like something she can make at home herself. Overall, food was just ok; nothing special. 

I probably won't come back as I feel that this one time experience is enough for me unless a friend of mine plan to host a party here in the future.",1
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,1,2020-05-24,"Ok, so I know this place is all the rage. 

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed.",0
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,2,2018-12-11,"I found this place while walking around Yorkville. I came without reservations but I was seated quickly as the restaurant was fairly empty on a weeknight. 

The restaurant is pretty spacious. They have a private dining room on the upper level for large groups. The ambience is upscale and relaxing.

Service:

The server was nice but she wasn't around very often. I had to wave another server down for more water since my assigned server barely checked up on my table.

Food:
Calamari Fritti - The calamari was pretty standard.

Fettucine Alla riviera -  The fettucine pasta was disappointing as the sauce was underwhelming. It was pretty bland. 

Gnocchi Alla Dimmi - The gnocchi was decent.

Overall:

Great location with a nice ambiance. However, poor service and overpriced, mediocre food. They may be busy but that may be because of their convenient location.",0
La Chingada,5,2019-03-18,"Alright, I better review this place before I'm late to the party. If they keep up with the quality they provided when I visited, you can expect them to become renown in the area and even the city. When that happens, I'll proudly remind people that I first visited before their grand opening.

I had the tinga de pollo and barbacoa. I'm not sure it's necessary to break down the ingredients as many are familiar with Mexican food. They key is that the food quality and preparation are exceptional here. It's hard to avoid cliches such as ""texture"" ""fully seasoned"" ""done right"" ""full of flavour"" when describing the food here, but that's exactly how my experience was. They are clearly using great ingredients, even down to the tortillas which are better than most places. As they say ""good food makes good food"".

I would also add they everything was exceptionally fresh and the prices are fair. Can't wait to go back and hope that they can keep this up.",2
House of Gourmet,4,2020-02-26,"It's a bit of a no-frills place -- definitely not too fancy place by any standards. However, it's a typical Chinese resturant serving an extensive menu with hundreds of items and fairly convienient in its location and hours. It gets kinda loud inside and they only allow debit and credit card over a certain amount but that's okay. 

They have a lot of the comfort food staples, like fried rice, congee, or mapo tofu etc. I typically come here for the cold cuts like the roast duck or BBQ pork (char siu). You can get it as a dish on its own or have it over rice. 

In general, if you're looking for Chinese take-out or a simple dish over rice, this is the place to be at. They also have more expensive stuff as well, like seafood but I'm not sure how popular it is.

And oh yeah, there's Hong Kong milk tea for like two dollars, which is pretty boss.",2
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,3,2019-12-15,"I have to give credit where credit is due - GB Noodles is the restaurant that made me a noodle-soup fan. I lived in China from 2015-2017, and while I was there, I didn't find a noodle soup I enjoyed. 

GB Noodles changed all of that. I used to love coming here. It was consistently delicious.

I'm not sure what's changed, but it definitely isn't the soup I remember. It's still good, don't get me wrong, but after coming back for the first time in about a year, I'm just not sure what's changed. The broth is decent, the noodles are still fantastic, but the overall effect left me a bit wanting.",1
Terroni,4,2019-09-03,"One of my favourite Italians in the city and not just for the food, this location is great for a meal out due to its ambience and the setting in such a historic, classic building - really adds to the experience!

Not to brag but being greedy I had a pizza, pasta and salad last time I went and all were great with fresh ingredients and the salad in particular was really refreshing sandwiched in between my carb medley!

Very good wine selection too.

House of Gourmet,3,2019-06-26,"Fairly average Chinese food but open late until 2:00 am with lots of seating. They are located a block or so from from Spadina on Dundas.

Their food seems pretty average to me except for their char siu (BBQ Pork) on rice that is my favorite. Everything else is ok but with the exception of great wok hei. If you're looking for a quick bite after a night out this place will do since they open until 2:00 am and has plenty of seating. Their menu is fairly intense about 500 items and with plenty of seating for a big group. 

The food comes out super fast piping hot. Service is ok just need to keep flagging someone down, their table turn over is quick that is the way they operate so don't expect stellar service but they aren't horrible either.",1
Terroni,2,2019-12-12,"Very spacious restaurant, a bonus for downtown foodies. 
The location used to be a bank, so the architecture inside is unique, interesting, and stunning.
(Be sure to visit washrooms and vaults in the bsmt.) 

The menu is not typical Italian, which was a bit disappointing for my group of 7, and they're not open to substitutions for dietary / halal purposes. 

Our server was very insistent about what we should and shouldn't apply cheese to, a quick suggestion would've been nice - but then let ppl eat how they want to!

Food was a bit bland, although their tomato sauce tastes fresh and authentic. The fresh cut hot peppers they bring to the table saved our meals. 
*Be prepared to cut the uncooked basil on the Margherita pizza yourself ‍ it's just placed uncooked in the center.  

Desserts are a different story, very nice presentation and the taste was even better! The Tiramisu & Creme Caramel were a nice end to a mehh unexciting lunch. 

Not a lot of veggie/salad/vegan options for those who have medical / religious restrictions. 
But if you're into fusion menus and meat in everything  - this is definitely a great place to go for that.",0
Mi Taco Taqueria,1,2019-08-28,"Unfortunate to see such a great and authentic place go down in quality after growth in business. 

I loved Mi Taco when it first opened, it has a real authentic feel to it, amazing flavours of everything. 

I went back today after a couple years out of the neighbourhood and was so excited to go back, I was happy to see how busy they were and they had renovated. 

Unfortunately the quality of taco took a MASSIVE hit. The corn tortilla was mush by the time my food came to me. No seasoning at all. What a disappointing experience and loss in Toronto's Taco scene.",0
House of Gourmet,3,2019-09-25,"If you're out late night and want to grab some Asian food, then this restaurant is the perfect spot as it closes at 4am. We came around 9:30pm and the restaurant was pretty packed. You can't expect over the top service compared to other restaurants, but for a typical chinese restaurant standards, this restaurant is on average with it. 

We ordered their bbq pork/roasted pork and the black pepper sauce rice with beef. 
- Bbq Pork/ Roasted Pork: As expected, since it was pretty late at night, the meat wasn't fresh. The roasted pork was cold and the skin wasn't as crunchy vs being fresh. The bbq pork was pretty dry and was not juicy at all.
- Black Pepper Sauce rice with beef: This dish was actually really good which is why the ratings not as low. Since it was cooked fresh, the beef was tender and juicy, and the sauce tasted great. Portion size was pretty decent but for the price you pay, you only really get 3-4 pieces of beef. 

I'll probably skip this place next time if I wanted late night food and try out some other restaurants which were pretty busy as well.",1
Banh Mi Boys,5,2020-02-20,"I can see why Banh Mi's are popular - really great food for great value.

Comal y Canela,5,2019-05-05,"Three visits to this place so far, and we've gotten the enmoladas (chicken mole enchiladas) each time. The mole sauce is addictive; The blend of spices, chilis, and chocolate is rich, creamy, and balanced. 

If you're looking for the next level of shareable nachos, the asada chilaquiles is a mammoth portion of salsa poured over tortillas and topped with steak, cheese, cream, avocado, and beans on the side. 

They also have a tasty carnitas, a solid birria and pozole, along with various tacos (we liked the gobernador and the cochinita so far). 

Most of the dishes come with three types of salsa, onions, limes, and cilantro to dress your food with.

For drinks, I'd recommend the Jamaica, a hibiscus iced tea, and the Tepache, fermented pineapple juice and piloncillo. They have a lower level of sweetness, which was appreciated.",2

Fieramosca,3,2016-07-03,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)

Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.

Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.

Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!

Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  

So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  

The food:

Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.

Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.

Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  

Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  

Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.

Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.

Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.

Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!

TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.

2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.

The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!",1

CHICKEN TEQUITA: a deep fried taco with guacamole and chicken. Could have been slightly more spicy. It was well marinated. 

CARNITAS TORTAS: this was delicious, a big CARNITAS loaded sandwich served with some nachos on the side.

Donatello Restaurant,2,2018-08-23,"Recommended:
Veal marsala with penne

Ok:
Shrimp and scallops in wine sauce

Meh:
Roasted bell peppers. They're ok, but the quantity makes no sense unless you have a group to share with.

This type of food is really not my thing. A bit too straight forward and bland.

The food is simple Italian, but not special. The veal was well seasoned but a bit chewy. Still it was better than the shrimp and scallops dish, which contained small scallops and shrimp which seemed overcooked or reheated.

Olive oil and vinegar bottles are covered with corks which are very greasy. I have no idea how these could possibly be clean. Your fingers get dirty at minimum.

For the price, I expect higher quality or at least more interesting food.

Service was a bit absent at times, but passable overall. They only have one credit card machine, which created a bottleneck of a few minutes. It didn't matter this night, but if you have a time constraint, it is not a fast meal. The waiter explained and apologized, at least.",0
Fudao noodle house,2,2019-02-04,"Cute concept, but the toppings are absolutely horrible! The price is very very low, but I found myself paying less for great food in Chinatown so the low price does not play any factor here.

The toppings to be put into the broth are of the lowest quality. The meat is severely freezer burned and sort of breaks apart in the broth once cooked. Their sausage also tastes like couch medicine in liquid form.. why? Fudao seemed like the perfect place on a freezing Toronto night for me to warm up, but I regretted my decision more and more with each bite that I took.",0
Wilbur Mexicana,3,2019-07-23,"For what this spot is, it's fine. It's a King Street taco spot serving the King West crowd. Meaning, it's a bit overpriced (my dining companion asked me ""Are you SURE you only want 3 tacos...?"" while I was ordering) and a bit gimmicky for my liking. To be fair, I was coming off of having some fabulous tacos a couple of days ago at a little neighbourhood takeout where they mostly serve Latinx locals, AND I'm generally not a fan of anything fusion.

You grab a table and then line up to order and pay cafeteria-style. Then you go to the salsa bar for a very good variety of salsas and pico de gallo. Servers bring the food when it's ready. 

The food itself was fine, though don't order the grilled avocado if you don't eat dairy. It's literally just a grilled avocado. Even a healthy amount of pico de gallo and salsa couldn't save it. I found the tortillas really dry.

Atmosphere is cool and the people watching is pretty great. It was very busy with the after-work crowd. I don't think I'd return if I was craving tacos, but I would definitely hang out on their expanded sidewalk patio for a drink and some chips and guacamole.",1

Fudao noodle house,5,2018-11-21,"I am a soup fanatic. I have soup summer winter fall, no matter the season. 

This noodle place fulfills all my criteria: clean, CHEAP, beautiful gorgeous food (I love it when they set down the huge stone pot of soup in front of you), wonderful selection of soup base (I go for the original in the summer, and spicy during winter), they even give you SHRIMP as one of the side dishes, PHEW! LUX! 

Free noodle refill 
Awesome service 
Discount when you pay with cash 
Close to campus 
(Almost) no wait time.

I'm just waiting for them to get $$$ so they can expand to a bigger venue (and possibly franchise it so I can have my soup closer to home..)",2
Zhang’s Kitchen,3,2019-12-24,"Service is very good...friendly ambiance but I'm sorry, I just did not taste the authentic chinese food that I want.  Maybe they are just giving a modern twist but not for me.  Also, the meat are so thinly sliced for the price it should have more than that.  It just my taste and maybe some people will not agree.",1

La Marquesita,2,2019-11-04,"I ordered a taco from here, the Monterrey Steak. So tiny, it fits in the palm of your hand. Taste was ok but I don't think it is worth $6-7.",0
La Carnita,5,2018-12-27,"AmaZing. Literally said wow every bite. This place gets buuuuuuusy and I can understand why. The atmosphere is very cool, kinda dark tho and loud but that's because of people around us. The food was amazing. I can't even make a recommendation because everything was so good. The only think I regretted ordering was the taco with fried chicken, the chicken was just too bite and oily. But the taco came with a peanut lime hot sauce that was to die for. Next time I would ask for grilled chicken on top of that taco order instead of fried. The steak taco was perfection. I wouldn't order more than 2 tacos... me and my friend has one small app (the shrimp), 2 tacos each and the churros and that was absolutely the perfect amount of food. 

Server wasn't really coming to us a lot but it was getting so packed by the time we ordered. 10/10 definitely want to go back.",2
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,1,2019-05-03,"When we arrived the restaurant was empty and silent. We were seated at a table that was sticky and bits of food left on the table. We ordered the Chinese burgers, pork soup dumplings and cold noodles. The buns were stale, the noodles were excessively greasy and had a weird texture, and the pork dumpling meat was fatty. After leaving the restaurant, both my girlfriend and I felt very uneasy, she threw up immediately. I originally decided to come to this restaurant based on the reviews but after my experience I would not recommend this to anyone.",0

Baretto Caffe,5,2020-01-23,"The rose pasta was so creamy and delicious. Highly highly recommend! Along with the hazelnut latte and white chocolate cappuccino, we thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this cafe. It was a bit hard to find at first and busy as we went around 1pm but it cleared up and we found a spot to sit. After trying the food, I understood why this place has a 5 star rating. You also get a free cappuccino if you spend over $20. The owners were so friendly and told us about the same cafe that their family owns in Italy.",2
Campechano Taquería,3,2018-06-04,"Great tacos with a good spice level! The food at Campechano is tapas style and they have a wide range of tacos. 

The guacamole is served with a side of spiced nachos - they were a little dry and stale, but the guacamole was fresh. The ceviche is an European bass, with a nice kick of spice as well. I ordered the fish taco which was freshly deep fried and simply delicious. 

The restaurant has a patio with outdoor seating, as well as bench like seating for larger groups. Unfortunately, the service is not as great as the food thus meriting a 3 star.",1
Bar Buca,3,2018-08-06,"Bar Buca was on my Bookmark list for brunch for a long time. Their egg skillet pictures impressed me. We didn't come sooner because my husband prefers a simple brunch menu which comes with eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, toast and salad. So, I had waited for a while until today.  

This afternoon I had trouble choosing which restaurant to have brunch at. We decided when it was 2 pm. Luckily, their brunch time is until 4 pm. So, we came to try out their eggs!  

FOOD (3.75/5)

- LA GRANDE COLAZIONE ($16). The dish comes with two hen's eggs, Italian sweet peppers salad (pepronata) and flatbread (tigella) . We saw the picture of the dish with FENNEL SAUSAGES on Yelp. It interested us and we both wanted to try it. However, I couldn't order the same dish as my husband did. I wanted to try something else also. I had a bite though (sigh). The sausage was small. It wasn't enough for two people lol. 

- UOVA CROCCANTI ($14). The dish came with three crispy duck eggs and topped with Buffalo Ricotta (cheese) and Pesto Genovese. The eggs and cheese were very flavourful. If you like cheese, you will love this. I'm not a big fan of buffalo ricotta. I like the taste but the smell was too strong for me. 

DRINK (4/5) 
We had Latte Macchiato ($3.95) and Americano ($2.90). Both were good. We love coffee. 

SERVICE (3/5)
I don't' really want o say that the service is mediocre. There are many reviews say that their services are great. Maybe it wasn't my day. My server was alright. She answered what I asked for but not really what I wanted. It was my first time and I wanted her to explain to us more about the menu and recommend us what the signature dishes are or what the most popular ones. We also don't know Italian! She said something. Short, and that was it! I could catch that those first few items on Salato section were salad and the half on the bottom were egg dishes, I guess. lol, I was disappointed! I was so excited at the beginning becuase I finally had a chance to come to try the brunch menu at Bar Buca. She just turned everything upside down. - -""

OVERALL (3.75/5)
The place was nice. The host was friendly. I love their eggs but I expect a bit more on their egg skillet and their service for the price. Would I come back again? I still want to try other dishes but I am concerned about their service.  We'll see!",1
Buca,4,2019-07-16,"We came for dinner on a Monday night and there was still a decent number of people within the restaurant even though it was a work night. The service was really nice as they helped suggest the best sellers of the restaurant.

Food:  For dinner, we had two pastas: Bigoli and Spaghetti Al Nero di Maiale and two pizzas: Prosciutto con Cipolle and Funghi. The duck ragu (Bigoli) was AMAZING, rich and perfectly cooked at al dente. The spaghetti had a unique taste in which it had a strong smoked taste which is not for everyone. I would recommend the prosciutto pizza because with the fresco it was delicious. On the other hand, the funghi had an overpowering Gorgonzola taste. Do not recommend! 

Overall, this meal was a bit pricey but it would be a great location for a date night as the ambience is dim, classy and rustic.",2
Lai Wah Heen,4,2019-04-03,"I recently attended a dinner at Lai Wah Heen with 9 others. We had made a reservation with the expectation of having a set dinner, but when we arrived, we discovered the menu we had been looking at online was no longer available. We were presented with a few other options and in the end, we selected one that everyone could agree on. 

This was my first time trying sea cucumber and I'm not sure I'll be jumping at a chance to have it again. The texture was really strange, and it kind of reminded me of chewing on cartilage. Not my favourite, let's leave it at that. My favourite dishes of the evening were the scallops and prawns, the Wok-baked lobster and the fried rice with foie gras. They were packed with flavour and left me wanting more. Every dish was quite good, actually - those were just the standout ones for me. 

The dessert was a bit weird, based on comments from a few people in my group. The dessert trio included a soup that consisted of sweetened red bean, which is quite typical for a Chinese dessert and there was a sesame ball with taro inside (I loved this) and a strawberry jelly roll, which I didn't really care for, and was apparently the strangest item in our entire meal, after a very interesting conversation about Chinese desserts. 

Service was really good. There were a few people taking care of us, which helped speed things along when it came to plating the food. They would first bring the large platter to our table so we could see (take photos!) and then swiftly move to a serving cart beside our table and divided everything up between 10 dishes. I much prefer this to letting us serve ourselves, and I wish more places would do this. It takes away any chance of someone feeling slighted if, for example, they didn't get the lobster claw, or the 'best' piece of chicken. 

It was a pricey meal, at $100 per person - plus tax and tip (not including any drinks you ordered) and it's definitely not somewhere I'd be going often, but it was a nice way to spend a few hours. I would definitely recommend it if you wanted to splurge on dinner.",2
Mexico Lindo,2,2018-06-06,"This place has been bookmarked for awhile and I finally had the chance to try out this local restaurant located in Scarborough. This is a takeout and dine in restaurant - very casual.

After ordering at the counter, they offer complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was so thin and watered down - no flavour whatsoever. I would have rather opted to not have it at all. 

I ordered the Chorizo Quesadilla which comes with beans, rice and salad. There are two sauces on dish but both were bland and lacking any taste. My sister ordered the Chicken Burrito which comes with the same sides, again it was bland and quite disappointing. I'm flabbergasted as to how this place has 4/5 stars when there are other places that taste so much better. Maybe it was an off day but this is not my first time having Mexican food. 

Sure the price is on point and portion is decent but quality and taste needs improvement. 

I'm sorry but I will not be returning.",0
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2018-04-12,"This place is pretty much the epitome of ""hole in the wall."" Tucked into a little strip mall, the restaurant is unassuming from the outside and tiny on the inside. There are no dine-in options - it's take-out only.

When you walk inside, you'll be able to see all the roast meats hanging and spinning. If the doors to the back room are open, you can even see the chefs chopping up the raw meat just two meters away. At the counter, you can see some of the side dishes on display, to help you decide what to order.

The menu has a variety of options, including duck, pork, and chicken, as well as sides such as vegetables and rice. I ended up getting the roast duck with steamed bok choy on the side. The roast duck was delicious - though quite messy to eat, due to all of the juices and bones. The steamed bok choy was lackluster.

The food was tasty and the tiny half restaurant / half butcher shop was quite an experience. It's worth a stop if you're craving some meat and aren't afraid of the grittier environment.",1
Mariachi’s Restaurant,1,2018-06-14,"We went with my children to this restaurant and the service was good but the food was mediocre and heavily priced for the value. I ordered a cheese melt, and got more sausage than cheese and the cheese was cheddar (this dish is not done with cheddar). For $40 dollars per person without alcoholic beverages, one would expect so much more. It was 7 pm and the place was empty. Very disappointed. We won't go back!",0
Tacos El Asador,1,2020-04-24,"Ordered beef burrito and pork pupusas through ubereats.

It was hard by the time I got to it. Think twice before ordering...",0
Giulietta,3,2019-05-03,"Some hits and many misses; 
Always sad when slow/ inattentive or simply bad service ruins great dishes. However, the setting, the space, and the wine list are great. 

The food: although executed greatly leaves something to be desired in flavour. Simple ingredients are supposed to speak for themselves here mostly, however more ""cooked"" dishes lacked savoury or original flavours that would make you go back for specific dishes. 

The good:  Cacio e pepe is great- am I running back for it anytime, maybe. 
The disappointing: Avoid the Branzino (sea bass) if you have a problem with bones- they make no effort in deboning it before serving. 

The main issue here is service. It was exceptionally slow; had to call the staff several time for refills, orders, more wine, where's our food... etc. T
he timing between each course needed to be shortened but half if not more. I don't think they want you sitting there for 3 hours without dessert even. There were too many loooong pauses during meal staring at an empty table waiting for another round of dishes. 

With lots of great Italian options in the city I would definitely consider it more like a wine bar with a few nibbles rather than a full fledged hearty meal.",1

Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2018-11-10,"It looks really sketchy outside but don't like it scare u away, cuz the food is pretty good! Let's talk about the 4 dishes we ordered:

1. Dan dan noodles. Okay I'm pretty sure it is not the authentic dan dan noodles but the way they presented it was pretty smart. All the spicy sauce is on the bottom of the bowl because if u can't take that much spicy then u don't have to stir all into the noodles. But other than that no comments.
2. Chicken dry pot. We ordered this because other three plate wasn't enough. It came on a stove and a pot, it tastes amazing but the fire down the stove is just really concerning I wish they could use some protection around it.
3. Spicy beef. ITS SO GOOD and SO SPICY. I freakin loved it!! I'm not joking about the spicy level of this dish so if u can't really take real spicy u need to bring ice milk with u. Also u need to try the numbing pepper that Sichuan cuisine has, it will numb ur tongue and it is such a cool sensation.
4. Double cooked pork belly. It's extremely salty, like super duper salty. We had to order rice to eat this. 

The service: the waiters and waitresses hang around but they r really slow at services.",1
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,1,2018-09-30,"I was craving soup dumplings and this restaurant has such good reviews that I just had to come here. It's a tiny restaurant down some steps, so it might be hard at first to find if you don't know what you're looking for exactly. There isn't a ton of seats, so if it's busy, you might need to wait for a table.

The restaurant itself could use a huge facelift. The washrooms were dirty and very small. The whole place just feels outdated - minus the tables and chairs. I came on a busy Saturday night but was seated fairly quickly. They cleaned my table before I was seated but the dish cloth they used to wipe the table was definitely used.. my table just smelled like a used dish cloth, sadly.
There were also a TON of mosquitos. We were seated right in front the of door, so perhaps this could be why.. but the most odd thing is that they would just drop onto our table and food, and almost die or stop moving instantly. Not sure what was going on.. but it ruined my appetite. 

ONTO THE FOOD: the most important reason why I'm reviewing! We ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings (soup dumplings), fried shrimp & pork dumplings, & chive pancakes. The soup dumplings were just okay. The filling wasn't as flavourful as other ones that I've tried from other places. It was missing something but I can't figure out what it is. The pancakes were really good, and I wish I ate more but they were dripping I grease, so I couldn't eat more than 2. I didn't have any of the fried dumplings but my boyfriend said they were very greasy as well. We actually had to go get a drink from a bar close by just to get rid of the greasy feel in our mouths.

I honestly wouldn't come back here myself. A lot of other people gave this place high reviews so I'm not sure if I just had a bad experience or not. But the greasy food and mosquitos flying around or dropped dead in front of us wasn't acceptable.",0
Como En Casa,1,2019-02-08,"$16 dollars for the worst burrito bowl/platter ever, are you friggin kidding me. Maybe because it was take out but that's hardly an excuse. The portion size is just pathetic, and the chicken was pretty dry even though it was fairly flavorful. It's not value for the money at all, highly disappointing. Go look at the photo and tell me if that's worth it. At least try a little.",0
Dumpling House Restaurant,1,2019-08-18,"TERRIBLE AND EXTREMELY RUDE SERVICE! LEFT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF FOOD. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GO.

My parents and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We ordered Singaporean fried rice noodle and the 15 steamed chives, egg, and dry salty fish dumplings for $10.99.

1. Noodles came out first (really small portions) and then they gave us the bill. We were like what??? Where is our second dish? And they were confused. They then realized they forgot our dumplings.

2. Dumplings came and only 14 out of 15 showed up. We let it slide. 

3. Zero eggs and salty fish in the dumplings. ONLY CHIVES 

4. When my parents paid the bill, the waitress got angry at us and asked why we didn't tip ... but we did tip and it was underneath the bills. So we were like ""excuse me??? Did you even look to see?"" She flips it over and sees the tip and then changes her energy completely and starts saying thank you. This woman had the audacity to get angry at customers who she treated so poorly yet actually still tipped. Im actually speechless.

Additionally, if you're asian and you complain about the food they just get pissed right back at you. And they tell you your opinion doesn't matter cause the Caucasian people don't seem to mind. Terrible",0
Khao San Road,5,2019-08-12,"Shared the Squash Fritters (gra bong) with 3 people as appetizers. It was such a perfect start - crispy, fried to perfection, and not oily. The sweet dip enhances the taste and makes you munch on it again and again. For main, I had the Khao Soi, it was absolutely amazing. It's by far the best Khao Soi I've had in Downtown Toronto (I've tried PAI, Sabai Sabai, Sukhothai and Salad King). I love the soup, and the noodles blend perfectly well with it. The overall ambience is trendy and in an elegant, modern setting. There are plenty of seats (has a 2nd floor).

Khao San Road's portions is big - it's around the same price as the other Thai places but leaves you way more satisfied. My recommendation is to avoid the ridiculous line up at PAI and come here instead for equally (if not better) Thai food.",2

Terroni,2,2019-10-20,"This restaurant is really for the experience. With such a lovely ambience and outstanding service from all staff, the food did not meet up to par with what you may expect.

For starters the food is on the higher price end, and smaller quantities. Although, it is all homemade pasta!! 

I've had homemade pasta before so I had high standards walking in.. I was so excited to try the Gnocchi because well, I LOVE Gnocchi. 

However, I was disappointed. The pasta itself was quite soft and seemed soggy with the red sauce altogether. There was no 'bite' to it, more of a 'mush'. I did not enjoy my meal and that left a significant impression on my take of what the rest of the entrees may be like. 

Note: Calamari & Earl Grey tea were delicious!",0

Ordered apps nachos with guacamole and beans .

Mariachi’s Restaurant,1,2017-05-12,"Almost gave it two stars (read to find out more) but the one thing I can't get over is serving an alcoholic drink to someone who specified ""virgin"", when you delivered it to the table she checked again that it was ""virgin"", you agree verbally it had no alcohol, she tries some, tastes alcohol and then you go -- ""Oooh actually this one is the virgin"".  Sure, if she was pregnant or on medication or driving, maybe the sip of alcohol wouldn't be *that* big a deal.  But if she was recovering alcoholic, that one sip could literally change her life, and it's up to you as a business to be honest and knowledgeable about what you're serving.

Things that were terrible:
- we had a reservation, they called us to confirm it was for 700 pm, show up, they say oops we thought 730 pm, they literally have to move people from their seats to accommodate us
- during the 45 minute wait for all this to take place, they took drink orders from us multiple times, but never served us drinks
- they dropped an entire plate of steaming hot chicken fajitas on the ground, it splashed boiling sauce all over people, and their clothes as well
- when i went over to the owner at this point to say - now that we are covered in fajita sauce - can we please have the drinks we keep trying to order? she made a HUGE stink about it, just immediately responded, ""We didn't do any of this on purpose, do you understand? We are doing our best"" and then going to every member of my party reiterating that, as though I had done some rude injustice to her, it was super embarrassing and unprofessional
- drinks still took an extra hour and they weren't good
- they served the birthday girl fajitas with no tortillas or sides, just the meat (she didn't ask for that modification)
- the food was so awful my poor fiance actually sent his BACK -- and this is a guy who complains about NOTHING
- bills took over an hour after asking MULTIPLE times
- the place was so warm they had to keep opening the front door to let in cool air

It almost got 2 stars because they did pay the dry cleaning bill for the jacket that was covered in fajitas sauce, but honestly, I can't forgive the alcohol incident.  This whole experience was stressful and awful. I have no idea why they took our reservation (none of us had been there before), we were clearly too big a group for them at 700 (or 730..or 800...depends who you ask) on a Saturday!",0
Baretto Caffe,5,2019-11-08,"I have been wanting to come to this spot since my last visit to Toronto based on their offerings, the Yelp reviews and pictures. Today was the day. 

The location is a bit strange behind an office building where you need to enter into the office building to get to the cafe. Once you are there the service is very attentive, the food is wonderful and really authentic. The seating area is very quiet and just a refreshing break from the congestion of the city.

Tried the egg noodles with shrimp wontons and shrimp dumplings. The noodles are chewy, the soup comes out hot and the veggies are cooked to perfection. The wontons are a must!

The majority of the tables were taken the few times we popped in. There's a wait if you don't want a shared table, but doesn't take more than a few minutes since most seem to be in and out and they're very quick with service.",2

It's one of our go-to places whenever we're near the area. There are times when they get really busy (usually weekend dinner), so try to make reservations if you can. I believe they take reservations on weekends before 6pm.",2
Trattoria Taverniti,1,2018-11-21,"I was in shock with food here...the food was extremely disappointing. For prices that are on par with most mid-range Italian restaurant, the food was horrible.
 
I came here with reservations and we were seated immediately. It was during dinner hours but they only had one staff serving all the tables. With just one server, the service was really slow from bringing us the menus and taking down our orders. 
 
Service:
 
The service was slow since they don't have many staff. 
 
Food:
 
My friend and I ordered two appetizers and two entrees to share. Out of the four items we ordered, only one of the item was decent with the rest being disappointing. 
 
N'duja bruschetta - We were deciding to order a bruschetta and opted for this one because it was different. The menu described this to be a bruschetta with a spicy pork sausage spread drizzled with honey. Although I was aware that this was going to be just a spread on bread, it looked disappointing when it arrived to the table because the spread was so thin. I was expecting something thicker to give it more flavor.  I also looked at other tables bruschetta and it looked very average.
 
Calamari Fritti - Another disappointing appetizer. When this arrived, I was a bit shocked because it didn't even look like there was batter... When my friend and I tried it, we both agreed that there wasn't enough crisp. The dish didn't look appetizing either.  
 
Gnocchi Gorgonzola - I wanted to try the gnocchi since the menu states they are handmade. The pasta came out and I thought the color was unappealing; it was like a greenish/greyish color. I guess it is because this sauce is a nutty creamy sauce. The texture of the gnocchi was chewy and nice. However, I wasn't a fan of the sauce.
 
Tagliatelle al Funghi Misti - This was AWFUL Some of the noodles were stuck together and this is the first time I've experienced this at a restaurant. The menu does mention this is a lighter sauce, and I thought it was a lighter flavor....but I didn't expect it to be less saucy.  There was BARELY any sauce actually.  The sauce was pretty much nonexistent and I felt like eating noodles in water. This pasta had no taste. It was $18 and it was literally just plain noodles without much sauce and flavor; the pasta was very dry. 
 
Overall:
 
I would never return. With most of their pastas ranging from $17-20, I was expecting similar quality to other restaurants in this price range. The tagliatelle was so dry and awful. The bruschetta also barely had any toppings on it.",0
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,4,2020-02-16,"Hip young Thai restaurant that meets or surpasses  the old school authentic Thai restaurant taste! Cool decor and atmosphere, played good music. Young waiters and waitresses. 

Accommodated us by seating us at the bar! They also had the option of traditional Thai floor seating. 

We were in a rush and opted to sit at the bar. The food was unreal!!!!!!!! 

We had a papaya salad for starters which we were hoping was spicy but literally had no spice factor at all. It was ehh...I have had better.

But the main dishes were top notch.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prow with chicken and I can not stop thinking about it. So delicious. The pad thai was also yummy. But the Pad Gra Prow was my absolute fav.",2
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2020-01-23,"Came here for team lunch for CNY. Oh man. This place is packed! When we got to the reception desk, the group in front of us did not have a reservation. They were turned away. Glad we did book the day before. 

Anyhow, Chinese food option in the financial district can be rare. And when my colleagues proposed  this place. I was thinking, let's give this a try. 

We got here and were led to our table. After we sat down, I saw the other tables were filled up in 15 mins. Talk about busy. One good thing is they got a lot of staff roaming around to deliver food. Yet, they were super busy regardless. 

We ordered our food and I went with the business lunch with meatball. The food did come out shortly after. The sauce for the meatball isn't super salty. Which I prefer. It has the right texture for the meatball. Other stuff tasted okay. It ain't bad overall, I wasn't wowed by the food.",1

When the gentleman finally asked for how many and we answered three, he told us 5 min. There were several open tables, not sure why we had to wait, especially since I'm visibly disabled. 

There was one table for two available at the front, and we watched him futz with it and add a third placemat to an already crowded table. When he motioned us over (he didn't come get us, just beckoned) I had to try to explain to him that this table was not suitable as my leg wouldn't fit. He said it was for three. I asked if we could have a four top. He said none were available. I tried again to explain that I'm handicapped and wouldn't fit at this tiny table. 

Let me be clear, there were other available tables, but they were 6 tops, and he didn't want to lose the seats. I offered to wait for a four top but he said he couldn't tell me how long that would be. 

So we left. So much for hospitality. He was rude and dismissive and I won't waste the drive again. We went next door to the seafood restaurant. It was fabulous.",0
Nodo Restaurant,3,2019-05-01,"My friend recently moved to the Junction area and we decided to try this place out. Unfortunately, we didn't have a great experience. I was the first to arrive and there were quite a few empty tables on a Friday evening. The hostess said that she'd seat me when the rest of my party arrived (understandable). 5 minutes later, another customer came in (she was an older woman) and said she was waiting on 2 other people. The hostess sat her down immediately, which was a little weird to me but I didn't want to cause a scene and didn't ask about it. When the rest of my party arrived, it took them forever to seat us as it was getting busier and they were slightly understaffed. 

The food itself was good but the portions were small for the appetizers. We ordered the burrata and octopus to share. The burrata salad tasted fresh but for $20 it wasn't worth it in my opinion. Likewise, the octopus was chopped up into tiny pieces and served with potatoes. We each had about 2 tiny bites of octopus. However, the most disappointing part of the meal was the main. All four of us got the duck ragu pappardelle and I was surprised that it came with tomato sauce. The pappardelle itself tasted fresh and they were generous with the duck but too bad they were drenched in tomato sauce. I've had amazing ragu sauce at other places before and this was overwhelmingly disappointing despite it being one of their best seller. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.",1
DaiLo,2,2019-09-06,"2.5 stars. Nice casual ambiance. The tasting menu is around $190 for two, after tax and tip. I was let down by the food. They have a tendency of using very strong flavours that were overwhelming and competing with each other.

For instance, the pea dumpling had black truffle, bone marrow, and bacon. I wish I could have tasted the pea filling and bone marrow more because that was quite delicious, but it was overpowered by the more dominant flavours.

The wontons in sweet chili sauce was my least favourite dish. It was way too sweet (desensitized my tasting buds for the next dish), and the wonton wrappers mushy and falling apart.

The tacos were doused in aioli and it made the whole thing just taste like spicy mayo.

The fresh leaf wrap was very good and texturally interesting.

I didn't think the tofu ""cheese"" Caprese salad was anything special, but the tomatos were nicely peeled to soak in the dashi.

The smoked duck is a smart menu item because it can be prepared ahead of time and has a longer shelf life, can be served cold (well it was served cold to us so I assume that's intentional). The downside is that the fat is not rendered at all. and cold duck fat can be very rubbery. The skin was also unpleasant. It was not similar to a duck prosciutto where the fat is tasty and thinly sliced. The purple potato mash was very boring.

The ""famous fried rice"" tasted purely of black truffle oil, so if you like truffle you'll enjoy this. Thankfully there were no other competing flavous. I didn't think it was special. I think dousing things in truffle oil is a bit of a copout.

Our server was very nice, but he was quite busy. We had to wait a long time for water sometimes, and the sparking water cups are so tiny that I was constantly running out. No  pitcher or bottle for the table. Time between dishes is also long.

Overall I don't regret coming here, but I'm not sure if I'd come back. The value for the quality of food was not worth it for me. It certainly was interesting to try once.",0
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,5,2019-11-23,"Special tacos are $6, which is more expensive than I am used to spending on tacos but you are also paying for unique, higher quality tacos. We had the Baja Fish and Carnitas tacos and they were delicious. Definitely a must-try place in Toronto.

Like many places in Kensington, the place is quite small and there aren't many seats. Be prepared to either stand at their standing tables or stand outside and eat. We stood at one of the standing tables which was fine because it doesn't take long to consume their delicious tacos.",2
Buca Yorkville,5,2018-11-21,"Amazing fiancé chose this restaurant- we love Italian. Welcomed and seated right away for our reservation last night.

We split the beet salad. Outstanding. 

My angel hair lobster main dish was expertly prepared. Fiancé had the whole octopus with pearl pasta and charred artichoke hearts. Definitely great. 

Glad we could walk there. Doubly glad to experience this restaurant. 

Our only wish: with such a fine dining restaurant, the bread service should have been gratis. We did pay for the focaccia and it was excellent; however, very few restaurants in this price point charge for bread service.",2
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,1,2018-11-06,"AVOID 
TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
BETTER OPTIONS ELSEWHERE
-  was served 3 risottos when I asked for one, and was blamed by the staff that I ordered that many
-  risotto was raw as well

I was quite excited to try this place with two friends. The miscommunication ruined the whole experience for me. 

Knowing that the lunch stops at 3pm and that the risotto takes 40 mins to cook. I called in ahead of time to speak to someone around 1:30pm to have my amalfi risotto ready as I was making my way there. I spoke to a server, I informed her that I wanted 1 order of the Seafood risotto for a table of 3 people. I think it was this point where the miscommunication happened. She agreed and said it will be ready for us.

We arrived at 2pm, we spoke to the initial server and I asked him about the risotto, that I called in about. And he's like is it for here or to go? I told him that we were dining in. 

We were seated and waited for 40 mins. Before the risotto came out. To our surprise they brought us THREE RISOTTO dishes. Mind you, on the menu the risotto dish serves 2 people. At no point in time between 2pm to 2:40pm there was any clarification on the order. So I asked the server and informed him that I only wanted 1. So he fetched the server that I spoke to on the phone. And she insisted that I ordered 3 Risottos. I tried to explain to her that party was not ready to eat 6 peoples portion of risotto.

My experience is already ruined at this point. I don't know why she would think that I would want 6 people amounts of risotto. I could've tried other things in the restaurant. 

The risotto itself looked amazing. So if the food was okay I didn't mind.

Unfortunately the risotto was under-cooked. It had a grainy, sandy texture that stuck to the teeth. I informed my guests, and another one agreed with me. I let the server know, he brought Chef Massimo Renzi tableside and he just told me it was cooked al dente, and that he used carnaroli rice. 

So know we're stuck eating extra risotto that was under-cooked. My other friend thought the rice was fine, until he tried the one underneath the top layer. I'm assuming that the chef probably tasted that top layer and thought the other rice cooked as well. 

The seafood in the risotto was perfectly cooked but the dish was spoiled under-cooked rice. 

I think ultimately the experience was ruined when I got 3 Risottos instead of 1. Which caused the quality of control to go down on the rice. 

You will see in the photos that you can see the centre of the rice. Which is an indicator that the rice was raw.",0
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-10-24,"A last minute decision as we were staying at Delta Toronto a 2 minute walk from our hotel!

Love the drink list: wine, beer, cocktails. A great place to have a drink with snacks. 

We seated by the bar area, so one of the bartenders was serving us. We were checked on frequently and the service was attentive.

Food was ok, quite standard and did not wow me. I though will come back or a night cap if I am in the area.",1
Good Hombres,5,2019-05-22,"$3.75 tacos! You can't go wrong! This little hidden gem is situated right across from Toronto Western Hospital. You can find street parking for free nearby. The tacos are made fresh and tastes very authentic! The staff are nice and chatty and it's a great place to have nice a quick dinner. I came with my partner and we ordered 5 tacos, quesadilla, and an apple soda for $30. This was the best $30 spent on tacos. If you like tacos, I would rate this higher than seven live tacos in Kensington as it's cleaner, more spacious, service is quick and food is amazing. 

My favourite was the pescado (fish) and carnitas (pork). The fish was cooked perfectly with a crunch and topped with good sauce. The pork was also nicely seasoned and dressed. They offer extra hot oil which isn't spicy (subjective) but the tacos tastes great without it.",2
Tacos El Asador,1,2020-02-14,"It is Valentine's Day, I was so happy my boyfriend came from the Netherlands to visit and we had the best day exploring the city, afterwards we were too tired to go out so opted to order in some good Mexican food! 

We consider ourselves taco connoisseurs, and often indulge in a tasty tactac. We were VERY excited to have so many taco options so we ordered 3 soft shells and 3 crispy shells (as other Mexican enthusiasts may know, is not as common as people may think to have both shells) 

To provide more context you didn't ask for ... this was the first MUCH anticipated spot on our taco tour of Toronto. 

We have a methodical and detailed evaluation system in place for reviewing and ranking our tacsperiences - the system ranks the following on a scale of 1-5 (5 being the best) ; 

flavour and freshness (1)
Moisture (0)
Mouth feel (1)
Crunch (0)
Contents to Shell ratio (0)
Cheese Quality (0 - cheese unaccounted for, still looking for it)
Smell (2)
Overall (4/35) 

This may seem bitter, however, we are AS unbiased as they come. 
Furthermore, we are highly liberal individuals. Our disappointment is immeasurable yet our day is not ruined, because we still have each other, and our view is lovely (will include pic) 

We hope this is a one off, and the in person experience is better than delivery.",0
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2019-08-30,"This place is a very busy spot downtown and it's the type of place you come and go or take it to go because of how tight the space is. I got the 3 type plate and they're okay. They're not bad but not amazing either (bear in mind, I eat a lot of tacos). Definitely worth trying out if you're already in the area but would I take an hr TTC ride to come here again? Nope.",1
Trattoria Nervosa,3,2019-03-24,"This is a very cute restaurant in the heart of Yorkville on the corner of Yorkville Avenue. 

Like most of the reviewers, I went for the popular dish, Malafalde di Funghi. This pasta dish tasted as good as it looked. It's creamy and the pasta was al denté. 

We sat on the main floor, which was buzzing on Friday afternoon. Next time, I'd like to check out the rooftop patio when the weather is nicer. 

The price is mid to higher end, which I'm not crazy about. And after reading other people's reviews, the taste for other highlighted dishes seemed more conflicted (less consensus -except for the dish I got), so this wouldn't be a go-to spot for me. 

Atmosphere is on point. It's not stuffy like most of the restaurants in Yorkville. It feels homey.

The server we had was super busy, but he did what he needed to do. He was very on point with pouring our champagne and always made sure our glasses were filled. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience.",1
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,4,2019-12-22,"The service was fast, staff was friendly. Their soup wanton was so good I had to get two orders! The soup within the steamed dumpling was complimented beautifully with their pickled ginger & red vinegar! The pork belly bao was interesting since you can construct it yourself, and the flavour of the marinated pork was mouthwatering. However, the menu is very long and the main dishes   are an afterthought compared to their dim sum.",2
Asian Legend,3,2017-10-28,"This was our first Chinatown experience and it left much to be desired. I'll start by saying that the menu is extensive, with over 160 items to choose from. Perhaps we didn't order the best dishes.

We ordered the soup dumplings with crab meat and pork, which were the highlight of the night. Both the Sui Mai and the chicken and cabbage potsticker, which were on special, did not hit home. They were both bland and could have used some salt. The last dish, stir fried Ho Fun with beef was good but the beef had an interesting texture, it had no chew and fell apart in your mouth. I'd say the noodles had good flavour but could have been better.

To sum up, the food was good. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad... it was good. The service was great. Food came quickly and servers were always nearby. If I do come back to this location, the soup dumplings are the only thing that I will be ordering again.",1
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,2,2019-11-17,"Tried the Dim Sum at dinner time- the quality leaves much to be desired although the food was hot and served with typical efficient minimalist ( they did top up your tea promptly) service. The Xiao long bao was completely dry; Char siew bao was dry and flakey ( below expectations). Pricey for the lack of quality.

Saw that they had Tiger beer which was a pleasant surpise 

We probably won't be coming back again .",0
Fieramosca,4,2017-09-17,"Enjoyed a delicious dinner with my mom on a weeknight after catching a fashion show in Yorkville.

We weren't super starving when we arrived so we each opted just for a main. I ordered a delicious glass of sparkling rose which was lovely.

For my entree, I had the mushroom pasta and it was so good. My mom had the veal piccata and loved it. Service was polite and just attentive enough.

Stelvio,3,2018-09-26,"This small restaurant isn't a place I would have chosen myself but was suggested to me by a local Torontonian. Stelvio has a location in Toronto as well as in Milan, so my expectations were set really high. The service was great but honestly the food didn't meet my expectations. 
Being a vegetarian my options were limited, so I went with the mushroom risotto. By the time it got to my table it was cold, likely because of the way they plate it; a thin layer of risotto in a large bowl, almost looks like a porridge. 
My colleagues went with the prosciutto and beef wrapped around a thick wooden dowel, which came with polenta fries and looked rather unique, they seemed to enjoy it. 
Wines are all on the pricey side... amarone starts at $185...

Service was great and friendly. I joined the waitlist on Yelp while we were ubering from Union. By the time we got there we waited less than five minutes.

Hacienda las Américas,1,2019-10-25,"Food was awful - worst tacos I've had in my entire life - the meat tasted funky like it had gone bad and was burnt. The rice was bland with zero seasoning. They never even brought out the app we asked for (but they did try to charge us for it). I have no idea how this place has so many high ratings, the only positive is the food is cheap (although even at this price point it's not worth it). Even the mojito was subpar.

I'd definitely recommend this place for its food and its romantic atmosphere!",2
Carisma,4,2019-01-09,"I booked a table at Carisma for NYE for a few reasons. First, I wanted something relatively low key since we had to head to the airport early the next morning. Second, I liked that they had their regular menu going on NYE and we weren't going to get a prix fixe meal; I find holiday ones like NYE and Valentine's Day usually disappoint. Third, it was walkable from our hotel, so we didn't have to contend with surge pricing or getting a ride (not sure how hard that is in Toronto, but it's a mess at home).

I'm not sure when the restaurant moved, the interior looks quite different from the pictures I saw in reviews. White tables, teal, velvet seating left it feeling much brighter that the old space. The acoustics aren't great, it was quite loud in the place which detracted from the romantic vibe they seemed to be trying to create.

We started out with cocktails and the burratina appetizer. He got a manhattan and I got an aperol spritz. They split the appetizer for us, which was very nice. The appetizer itself was good, but not outstanding. We had planned to each order an appetizer portion of pasta and a secondi, but our server felt that might be too much food. Instead, we opted to split the gnocchi as our primi, which again came split for us. It was creamy and rich and the gnocchi delicate, but I felt that it would have benefited from a but more salt. For my main, I got the sea bass and boyfriend got the filet. We also split a bottle of valpolicello. My sea bass came over veggies and potatoes and was quite delicious - my favorite of all the things I ate. Boyfriend like his dish, but felt like it had a bit too much char on it. 

For dessert, we had a glass of dessert wine and split the walnut tart. Both were quite good and to cap off a very filling meal, we had a glass of champagne at midnight with those that stuck around to ring in the New Year.

Service was attentive and knowledgeable. My only knock is that the pacing at the beginning of the meal was quite fast. We had barely finished the last bite of burratina when our gnocchi arrived.

Overall, I got what I wanted; a nice low key NYE and a good meal.",2
King’s Tacos,4,2019-10-24,"I really like this place. It is bright and clean. The food is good and the service is great. There are two shortfalls; no fish tacos, no liquor license.

Sichuan Garden Restaurant,4,2017-09-13,"Still one of my favorite original Chinatown establishments. I love the staff here - all bilingual and super friendly and treats you like family, especially if you speak Mandarin ;) Whenever I get cravings for traditional Chinese vegetarian dishes like lotus root, Chinese mushroom and fungus, mapo tofu, etc I come here. I also come here when I feel ""heritage-sick"" and need to reconnect with people who remind me of my family. Many customers here are regulars and know the staff personally. 

They will make all sorts of accommodations for dietary restrictions or special diets, such as vegan/vegetarian, e.g. mapo tofu usually is made with meat so remember to tell them at the beginning that you are vegetarian. 

Downsides are that they put way too much cornstarch, salt, and MSG in all of the mains. I definitely don't recommend the ""Bamboo shoots with Chinese mushrooms"" dish as everything was literally swimming in a broth of corn starch and the bamboo shoot was a bit stinky (as it should be, but just note that it is an acquired taste). I recommend the mapo tofu - it isn't that spicy at all! Also recommend the mixed vegetable stirfry, which contains Chinese black fungus (so yummy and crunchy!) and lotus root. This one has less corn starch and is on the lighter side.

Prices are low - most dishes are under $10 - and portion sizes are large. Rice/carbs do not come automatically with main dishes, so you do have to order these separately.

They accept card as well as cash.

Will be back!",2

I asked them to forget about it as really had to go. They reimbursed me cash and I left annoyed that I never ate my food and was starving.

La Carnita,3,2019-08-21,"My friends and I (6+ people) came on a Tuesday for the Tuesday special where you get 8 hardshell tacos to share. My friends ordered the other tacos and really liked the 'In Cod We Trust' taco. We also had quesadillas, corn, and churros (really delicious btw, I highly recommend). I also ordered a cocktail and was surprised at the alcohol content, despite the small portion. Overall, I found the food to be really tasty and well seasoned! I just found the portion sizes to be quite small for the prices they were charging.

Our server did a great job on checking up on us and keeping up with our orders. We would occassionally just blurt out to add another item and I was impressed that they remembered it all- thank you!! Our server was also quite engaging, which made this place very welcoming and down to earth. 

The interior is decorated quite nicely and this place is very hipster. I would also recommend booking a table because, despite the numerous amounts of tables, quite a lot of them were reserved. There is also a bar for people who want to pop by for drinks only. 

The food came at a timely manner and the place was quite comfy. We were decently full but the prices really weren't worth the portion sizes we were given. This knocked back a few stars for me. Also, the bill could not be separated so figuring that out with a large group was not so favorable.

Itacate,3,2020-03-07,"Came for lunch around 12:30. The place only has two tables and some standing room. After you order and pay, they give you a number and  you seat yourself. 

The tacos all tasted good but were quite overpriced at 6 bucks each. The enchilada tasted good and was better priced at 8 bucks. 

I didn't feel the service was great, the cooks seemed annoyed when orders started piling up or when a customer asked for the provided cilantro/onions/ salsa to be refilled. Space wise the place sucks with only two tables. They also said there was not bathroom for customers ( even though if we paid). Floors and tables were not clean either. 

I also asked their facebook page a few days before my saturday visit if they have tamales. It's on the menu and some reviews on other review sites mentioned they are not usually available. I got a reply within 1 hour that they would have tamales around noon. When I asked about them, i was told they make them some weeks and not others. I do not think they are worth returning to. There are other taquerias in the city that have cleaner restaurants and friendlier staff. Take out might be ok.",1

It is deceptively large since it spans the full basement level of the building, so it is easy to find seating.

Como En Casa,5,2018-08-16,"TLDR: Fantastic staff and service, good homey atmosphere and some of the best Mexican I've had in Toronto.

I came here after work one day for dinner. Upon walking in the menu is on a giant poster to your right and it lists out a couple options (no more than 20) and you order and pay at the counter before getting served. As soon as I walked in one of the staff immediately greeted me and welcomed me to the restaurant. I don't usually comment on service, but the service I revived from multiple staff at Como En Casa was absolutely amazing and therefore noteworthy.

I got the enchiladas ($13), which came with rice and beans as well. The chicken enchiladas came in threes with the mole sauce surrounding it, a white sauce drizzled on top of it and some lettuce and a type of cheese stacked on top if it as well. The chicken inside was very soft and overall the enchiladas were delicious. The mole added a nice kick to it as well. The rice was well-seasoned and very tasty and I could've easily downed a couple more servings of it. I'm not usually a bean guy, but the beans were prepared very well here as well. They were mashed to a thick-ish consistency and the taste of the beans was not overwhelming, which I usually find at other restaurants. The meal also came with a homemade mild-hot sauce which was also very good. I think my only complaint is that the portions could've been a bit larger (at least for the rice and beans, which are pretty cheap). However, the meal was good enough to make it worth the price anyways. 

I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.",2
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2019-10-26,"This place was ok. We tried the roasted duck, roasted pork, and bbq pork, and pork tongue. Taste was average. Duck was very hard to bite through. Meats were cut sloppily and some barely cut. Floor was sticky. With so many better options around, probably won't try again.",1
Taverna Mercatto,2,2018-12-22,"Came here for a team lunch and ordered the fixed menu because the main menu apparently wasn't fully available during lunch.....very confusing menu setup but ended up ordering the risotto and cheese fried balls and the roasted chicken.

The risotto cheese balls were surprisingly good because when the dish arrived it was very underwhelming. The balls had a really good crust and when i fried poked into one it had a really good cheese pull. What i also enjoyed was the tomato sauce at the bottom which cut the oiliness of the fried balls significantly, a really good match.

The chicken however was very disappointing. The chicken was very tender on the inside but that was probably because small chunks were undercooked and raw ish....the pasta under was kind of dry and clumped together. Lastly the texture was a little boring, there was a little bit of char on the skin but seems to be only from the salamander so the really wasn't a real crust on the chicken.

Overall the restaurant seemed good but just didnt get a good experience this time.",0

El Charro,2,2018-08-27,"Had an appointment across the street so I saw this Mexican place and decided to try it out. It's very nicely decorated -- vibrant colours, a mural, and lots of Mexican decor. 

I decided to go with a veggie burrito as I am vegetarian, which came up to $9 flat. I was told at the cash that it's 10% off if you pay with cash (not sure if that's an everyday thing but at least I know for next time). Anyways, I was served right away and I was in and out within five minutes I'd say. The burrito itself was not the greatest--pretty bland compared to other veggie burritos I've eaten (and I eat a lot of them lol). I've also never had a burrito with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots in it so this was a first for me . Honestly tasted like I had some type of Asian stirfry in my burrito which really threw me off. Guacamole is supposed to be included but I couldn't even taste it . To be honest I didn't finish a quarter the burrito because I just didn't enjoy it at all. A piece of the cauliflower actually fell on the ground by accident there was a bunch of pigeons around me that really enjoyed it lol  

Would I come back? Probably not. If I was in the area I'd be open to trying something else on the menu because I see a lot of great reviews but I don't see myself ever coming out of my way to come here again.",0
Trattoria Taverniti,1,2019-09-09,"I was craving pizza for supper this evening.  I was walking along College Street and came across Trattoria Taverniti.  It looked interesting and I'd never been there so I thought I'd check it out.

When I got here around 6:30pm, it was fairly empty but filled up pretty quickly.

I ordered the Carne pizza.  It was a good pizza and I ended up taking some home for lunch tomorrow.  The crust was crispy and I guess it was the sausage that had a bit of a bite.

I paid my bill and was finishing up my wine, getting ready to go.  Then one of the servers asked if I would move to the patio to a high top chair because they needed my table.  I said I wasn't going to be much longer and didn't want to move to a high top (I have a wonky knee).  About ten seconds later, the second server came over and asked me to move and I told her the same thing.  About five minutes later, one of the servers said I really had to leave because they really needed my table.  I just had a sip of wine left and again said I'd be leaving shortly (and did).  I felt a bit uncomfortable because the table next to mine was looking over and wondering what was going on.

So what started out being a pleasant meal got ruined.  I understand that a small restaurant needs to turn the tables over to make money.  But if the table was reserved and I needed to be gone by 7:30pm (so in about an hour), they should have said so when I was seated so the expectations were set ... rather than kicking me out because someone else needed the table.  Definitely a customer service fail.  As good as the pizza was, I didn't feel valued as a customer so won't be back.",0
Los Guaca-Moles,3,2019-07-07,"The service was great and the ambiance was nice too. I most definitely will come back for drinks.

However, the food was too pricey and the portions too small - it wasn't worth it.
My boyfriend got the Alambre vegetariano for $18, which consisted of 3 tiny tacos filled with a bit of veggies and a small rice tower next to it. For that price he was expecting a nice and filling meal, not a sad appetizer sized meal.",1

Terroni,3,2020-01-27,"For so many years, I have never visit Terroni.  Actually after dinner tonight I don't think there's an urgent need as everything was normal and on the pricey side.

Was looking at the mushroom pasta special for Monday and the cost was  31.  I asked the waiter what's the portion sIze and he told me 5 pieces.....really?!

OK I went with the grilled calamari for $18 and a side of rapini for $10 instead.  Well, the calamari was alright, I like the tomato arugula salad a lot underneath but the rapini wasn't good as it was super hard to chew.

My friends had the $170 steak combo which came with a salad and a plate of veggies and it tasted good.

So my verdict is 2.5 stars  round up to 3 here we don't have half star option for review.  Prob won't be back tbh.",1
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,4,2020-02-16,"CASH ONLY!!! & the location is kind of odd and the place is super tiny! But through it all the tacos are delicious....

All tacos are 6 bucks each. 

I ordered 2 tacos and was super full! I got the smoked marlin taco and the camarones a la diabla.

The camarones a la diabla was so fire!!! All the flavors were perfect. The marlin taco was not bad but a little on the drier side. Def would recommend the camarones a la diabla!

I tried the HOT salsa - and I like spicy but this was reallllly spicy! Good flavor tho but just an FYI for those daring souls.

I did not like that they didn't have small cups for salsa and you had to put your salsa straight on your taco. It's some what unsanitary from my perspective.",2

LOVED IT!",2
Fudao noodle house,4,2018-11-11,"What I got: Original Rice Noodle ($8.49) and Pickled Cabbage Soup ($9.99)

Pros:
- Came here on a very rainy day and was able to get seats despite this place being pretty busy on a weeknight. 
- The soups here are supposedly made with no MSG, so you won't have to feel guilty about drinking it.
- Lunch menu is quite worth it, for ~$10 you can get soup noodles, with appetizer and drink. 
- Free refills on the noodles but not on the seafood/meat/veg you put in the soup. 
- Overall a great place for cheap eats with a nice selection of little items you can put into the soup.
- I'd recommend you to put everything in while the soup was still boiling to avoid eating raw seafood.

Cons:
- Take debit and cash only
- The seating arrangement can be a bit tight so you can hear the conversation of the people next to you.
- The Pickled Cabbage soup was on the saltier side, so I would recommend the thai or original one more.",2
Chula Taberna Mexicana,5,2019-07-31,"Food was amazing. Things that stood out and a definite must try were the: ""Mexican street corn, the cactus dip (best item on menu imo), the zucchini fritters and the chicken enchilada. The patio is super cute and great for just chilling with friends and having some yummy cocktails. Loved the vast tequila selection as well!",2
King’s Tacos,5,2020-01-15,"This year has really started off well for me (at least in terms of food haha)

King Tacos is a family-run Mexican restaurant on St. Clair West. We ordered Gaucamole, Chicken Tacos and Beef Bistec Tacos. 

You do get free fresh chips and sauces with all orders, which I think is super! 

The whole concept is amazing. You get FRESH tacos in a taco box, you assemble it yourself, which I think is nice. You also get 3 different sauces to add to your tacos and you can add cheese too! 

It's very authentic and similar to how it is in Mexico! It's quite a large restaurant with lots of seating. The only thing I would say it as it's family run, it's a little slow. They're definitely hospitable and friendly but the service is a little slow, even for a weekend lunch. I won't ding them for this because the flavours of everything we ordered was scrumptious. Large portions don't hurt either ;)",2
Wilbur Mexicana,3,2019-12-08,"Gringo af. Lunch and dinner lines go out the door. Don't come here for your undersalted chips and measly-portioned guac. The meat was kind of too salty and even having three tacos made me want a fourth. I guess it's FINE that there's fish tacos but it's kind of overrated. Where is the cilantro?!?! 

I have had better. It's got an Assembly Chef's Hall vibe. It's loud, jammed full of working professionals. Only come here if everything else is closed.",1

Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2019-12-22,"Although the surroundings of a cellar-like space was nice, the overall pricey but subpar food, elementary plating/plates, and clumsy service was a let down especially in the Yorkville area.

I ordered their fish special of the night: Swordfish with a Side Salad. It was expensive, but the portion was great and the fish cooked & seasoned well!  The side salad was very basic but fresh, thankfully I had asked for the dressing on the side...especially since we previously ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer that came with some VERY greasy side salads. We ended our meal with some desserts, I tried their creme brûlée, but for $9.95 it was a rip off since the ramekin wasn't fully filled and the custard texture felt a little too whipped. Also, a little ridiculous that they charged us for hot water.",1
Itacate,2,2019-10-19,"This is a tough one! As some of you may know I love Tacos! I kept hearing that Itacate was the best place to grab the most authentic tacos in Toronto and obviously I had to give it a try. This little spot is located on St.Claire W and it doubles as a Butcher shop. I walk in and it smells amazing! I love pork tacos and since I can cook all other tacos I decided to get the Carnitas and El pastor. I was so excited and 2 of the saddest looking tacos were brought over. 

Now, looks are not everything so I decided to take a bite. Even though the tacos were super plain I figured if the meat is super flavourful I won't need any sauces. The meats were very chewy, at one point I felt like I was eating leather. Most of the Pork had gooey fat all over it and I just wasn't a fan. I added cilantro, onions and the extra spicy sauce which helped with flavour but the meat was a big issue for me. 

Keep Eating,

La Carnita,3,2019-07-06,"2.5/5 stars. Delicious gourmet tacos, but pricey.

Food: 4/5. Everything I tried was delicious. We started with chips + 3 dips which I would highly recommend.  It came with tomato salsa, corn salsa and guacamole. I also really enjoyed the flavour of my tacos. I got:

- Achiote Chicken. My least favourite but still decent. 
- Crispy Cotija. Basically fried cheese, which you can never go wrong with. 
- Carnita. Pork taco with amazing fixings. This was my absolute favourite. 

We also got a pitcher of one of their daily special drinks, which was a pineapple beer. The glass came rimmed with HEAPS of salt which everyone at my table hated - salt & beer? 


Service & Atmosphere: 2.5/5. Loud & dark space. Hipster in style. Server was nice but visited our table very rarely. There were 5 of us at the table being billed separately. All of our bills were out of order. I had a taco missing from my bill, which got added on to someone else's bill, etc. When we tried to say something to the server she just handed us the debit machine. We ended up figuring out her billing mistakes ourselves and paid each other back the appropriate amounts. 


Value for Money: 2/5. This is where it really falls flat for me. Each MINI taco is about $6.00 each. They can be finished in 2 bites. That's ~$3.00 per bite. They are mini tacos too so you'll need a few of them to feel satisfied.",1
El Trompo Taco Bar,2,2019-05-20,"I'm very confused on the tacos we received vs all these amazing reviews...

First timers at Kensington so we decide on this taco joint because Seven Lives was too long around 1:30p. 5 small tacos come in an order and you can only mix and match Al Pastor, Tinga and Chorizo. So we decided to get 2 Tinga and 3 Al Pastor. The tacos literally came out in 2 minutes after ordering. Too quick :3 The taste was bland and unappealing.

Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-08-13,"I'm still so full writing this review; which is usually a good sign!

The service was good all night, including the full glass of water my boyfriend knocked right off the table that was immediately cleaned up, so that aside:

We started with a bottle of wine, Priorat, which was delicious! About ($100), a great Spanish red, highly recommend.

First came out the calamari ($14) delicious but quite a small portion, more for one person than it was shareable.

I got the Carbonara (basic and $18), it wasn't at all spectacular, in fact it wasn't even memorable. And the portion was not that large either.
My boyfriend got the 8oz ($38) and the cook was perfect, while the star of the dish was the layered potato serving oh my 

Followed up with an Amaretto, and a tiramisu for me (creamy, flavourful, large, filling, delicious!!!) and a caramel something for my boyfriend (also creamy and delicious!)

Highly recommend dessert over everything else we had! It's a cozy place to go after work, but not that impressive really. I'd call a 3.5/5 an accurate rating! 

Pictures attached!!

Will I be back? Unlikely, maybe just for that tiramisu some time",1
Buca Yorkville,5,2019-05-31,"TL;DR Upscale delicious Italian seafood

After trying the other Buca restaurants (which were fantastic), we were not disappointed by Buca Yorkville and can totally see why this place is rated in the top 5 for Canada's Top 100 Restaurants. Its quality and flavours are on par with other top-notch restaurants in Canada. 

Spot prawn crudo 5/5 - started with spot prawn freshly flown in just a few hours before. You can taste how fresh it is with its sweet notes and tender meat. It is absolutely divine.

Nodini 5/5 - One of our favourite classic dishes from Buca. The bread knots are small spheres fried with light salt and garlic. 

Nnocco fritto (squid ink dumplings with tuna n'duja) 5/5 - this was our FAVOURITE dish of the night. We had no idea what it us and took Yelp's recommendation for it. It came with 6 little pockets of bread that you can stuff with spicy tuna and n'duja. The flavour and texture was incredible. Definitely give this a try. 

polipo e vongole 3/5 - this octopus dish is where things fell flat for us. The octopus was cooked with clams and bone marrow. Both the clamps, bone marrow, and stock were delicious and rich in flavour. However, the octopus itself lacked flavour and char. When you bite into the meat, there was no chew or tenderness, felt very mushy and bland. 

Bigoli 5/5 - our second time order the duck egg pasta. This is a must try when you come to the restaurant. The noodles are perfectly al dente and coated in duck offal ragu. If you're weirded out by innards, do not fret as you do not taste the gameyness at all. The sauce is rich and rounded.",2
Buca Yorkville,2,2019-10-18,"We ordered three pasta dishes all of them were mediocre; lobster, vongole and octopus. Lacking flavor and pasta overcooked. Very skimpy on the seafood. Fail. Never again. Not worth the calories. Very disappointed and I'm a carb/pasta whore.",0
Lai Wah Heen,3,2019-06-02,"Lai Wah Heen used to be the best luxury dim sum restaurant in downtown Toronto. Overtime, the quality of the restaurant declined. While services and atmosphere still remain the same, quality and price are no longer on par. 

Out of the four items my brother and I shared, the best item was fried bean curd sheet with mushrooms served with aged balsamic vinegar ($5). It was crispy and juicy. Truffle Snow pea vegetarian wrap was unfortunately subpar ($5.5). The snow pea is not picked and over-steamed. 

With that said, it may still be a good option if you are a downtown dweller. However, I would not recommend Lai Wah Heen if you have access to dim sum restaurants in uptown Markham and Richmond Hill.",1
Yummy Yummy Dumplings,3,2020-02-28,"Went there because craving for dumplings and saw good reviews online. Their shop is a bit old style but that isn't a matter.

Service: Their understandings of English is really low. I know they're Asian but still communication is key especially running a business. Realized most asian restaurants nowadays required customers to write on a paper for ordering

Food: Food was delicious! Handmade and freshly made to order. Like the chewiness of the noodles and the thinness of the dumplings.

However, they gave me 11 dumplings rather than a dozen. I didn't give a tip because of the poor communication and missing food but they complained about that :/",1
Lai Wah Heen,2,2019-05-07,"We came here for Peking Duck around late lunch time and ended up getting dim sum.

Steamed barbecue pork bun: yes! Get this! Flavorful and light. I also enjoyed the pork shrimp and scallop siu mai.

Average items: deep fried mini shrimp ball

Things I didn't care for: deep fried dumpling of Berkshire pork and baby shrimp (tasted like a sesame ball with a filling), baked mini egg tart, steamed soft bun filled with custard, tapioca lychee and mango in chilled sweet soup

DO NOT GET: steamed short spare rib in garlic and toasted garlic. This dish was horrendous! It was slimy!

We weren't too impressed so we left to have another meal around the corner.",0
Artisan Plus,4,2020-01-09,"Pros:
Well done hand pulled noodles
Nice variety on menu

Cons:
Seating is tight

Artisan has been in the North York area for quite a while.  This place is there venture into the downtown core.  This much larger location is welcome addition to the downtown area.  Fans of hand pulled noodles should give this place a try.

As I mentioned earlier, this location is much larger than it's North York counterpart.  However, being downtown, it is subject to some limitations as well.  As with many downtown restaurant locations, I feel the seating is tight.  It's a veritable obstacle course when the place is full and everyone has their stuff with them.  The seats here are all of the stool variety as well.  There's a little slot for some space to put your things.  But with most people, you will not have anything to hang your jackets, bags etc on which means you probably place it nearby on the floor which adds to the obstacle course.

I was actually impressed by the menu here.  They have a good assortment of noodles to choose from here.  Some of them seem like original creations that you can't just find anywhere else.  I settled on the classic braised beef noodle and my wife got the clam mashi.  

As you can see from my pics, the presentation on their dishes here are spot on.  Every dish that came out from the kitchen looked very good.  I have to be honest, when my bowl of noodles came out I thought I was going to have to eat something else after.  The bowl was on the smaller side for beef noodles.  However, they do pack a good amount of noodles in there. It should be more than enough for normal appetites.  Big eaters like I am should definitely consider the extra noodle options.

Taste wise, the beef noodle was on point.  The broth was nice and not overly salty.  Noodles were pretty good with some bite.  They weren't the best noodles I've ever had, but they were very good in their own way.  The beef was tender and at least stewed for quite a bit before being served.  All in all, great bowl of noodles.  My wife's dish felt more like an Italian pasta dish.  If it wasn't for the spiciness and the wood ear mushrooms, you could easily serve it at an Italian restaurant and nobody would bat en eye.  Even the noodles looked like gnocchi!

Service was great overall during our visit.  A little disappointment that they only accept cash and debit.  Overall, this is a great little place to try our if you're a fan of hand pulled noodles.  There definitely some of other dishes I saw that I would like to try next time I'm here.",2

Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2018-07-24,"It was fun get together at Mariachis last week when me and my friends decided to go here. 
We primarily wanted to try the spicy margaritas. We got the jalepeno cucumber pitcher and the spicy pineapple one. Both were delicious. They got us the frozen style margaritas and I am not sure if they have the on the rocks option. 

During summer they have seating outside which is a small space with quite a few tables in the area. A decent place to sit, however it can get crowded. The place is located on the main road so it's easily accessed. 

We ordered food chicken fajita and our friends got the enchiladas. The fajita were a bit too saucy and wasn't really crisp. We also got some guacamole and that was delicious. So foodwise it was so-so but for drinks it was a really fun place to be!",1
King’s Tacos,3,2018-08-26,"I was on the street car when I noticed King's Tacos. I was curious so I went in for a bite. I was expecting a fast food restaurant like Taco Bells, but it was a sit down restaurant. King's Tacos decor was plainly decorated in a casual restaurant style. The service was okay, but you have to pay at the front.

The service started with the waitress bringing little bowls of sauce and onions. I am not familiar with Mexican food or tacos. I ordered the Arrachera taco which is made of beef fillets. I added the ingredients and sauces to the tacos to add flavours. I thought that the tacos were okay.

Would I go back? Maybe to try the other tacos. But I am not familiar with Mexican cuisine so it is hard to evaluate the food.",1
La Vecchia Ristorante,2,2019-07-08,It was under cooked noodle and no savory at all in my pasta. Overpriced and it's not worth to paying for it.,0
Mi Taco Taqueria,3,2019-05-03,"Hidden away on Queen West is this blink and you'll miss it taco joint. The interior is roughly the size of a shoebox, decorated festively, with a fake slanted roof. The roof makes it feel unnecessarily cramped. 

This place was rather disappointing. I brought my friends here because I enjoyed it a lot the first time around, but this visit was nowhere as good. The service here was wonderfully efficient, but the food was disappointing. I ordered the 3 taco plate (2 carnitas, 1 chicken tinga), chips and salsa verde, and a margarita. My total bill was around $22, which was not bad. The margarita was the best part of my order. 

Unlike other places, the margarita was strong. I got a good buzz from just one glass of margarita. It wasn't too sweet or tart or artificial-tasting, but rather perfectly balanced. The same cannot be said for the similarly green salsa verde. With saltier chips, the salsa might have tasted better, but with the very plain tortilla chips, the salsa tasted underseasoned and very vinegary - badly in need of salt. 

The tacos were similar in taste - while the freshness of the ingredients inside can be tasted, there wasn't enough of it, and it was hard to tell the difference between the chicken and the pork. A bit more seasoning could have helped. Lastly, the corn tortillas were absolutely dreadful. I had several mouthfuls of dry tortilla without filling to give it flavor and much-needed moisture, and it was like eating paper. I think the tortillas were kept under heat lamps for just a bit too long.

In summary, I'd come for the margaritas, but would not consider it this the best tacos in town.",1
Khao San Road,3,2019-10-02,"Spice levels were a bit all over the place. The curry was spicier than the pad thai and chicken kua gling, even though we ordered it with less spice than the others.

Al Pastor was the most unique one of the 3 with the addition of pineapple. Hot sauces were good, one green and one red. Service was really nice.",1
Buca Yorkville,3,2019-08-24,"Debated long and hard on what rating to give; ultimately decided on a 3.5, but rounded downwards to a 3! Although I had a great time there with  colleagues, it was really due to the company. The food was decent (neither spectacular nor amazing), but the service was, for the most part, non-existent. It took so long to flag someone down!

We had reserved a table for 10 at 6:30PM, and were seated in a private area, slightly hidden from the rest of the restaurant. To start, we ordered a selection of three salumi di mare. Don't be fooled! While many things here at Buca Yorkville are seafood-related, the salumi does contain some pork options. With the server's recommendation, we got the Soppressata di Polipo (octopus salami which therefore includes pork), Opah (cured moonfish), and I believe the Salmone Affumicato (smoked salmon). Accompanying this spread were gnocco fritto, fried squid ink dumplngs made with pork fat, and two small pieces of pickled onion. The smoked fish was the best and absolutely stole the show! It had a very rich and smoky flavour, and the saltiness whet my appetite. However, the other salumi were just okay.

A must order at Buca is the nodini - these small garlicky bread knots that are little bites of heaven! As my manager says, these are the ""yesdini"". We got two orders for the table, but as the knots disappeared in record time, we ordered another two portions. These nodini really stole the show!

We then ordered our own mains; I got the Polipo e Vongole. A small whole octopus came placed on top of some clams and crispy artichokes, with these al dente small pasta balls (the fregola sarda, which resembles couscous) soaking up the delicious broth. However, the octopus truly fell flat. It was soft, but lacked all flavour - it was bland, unseasoned, and just didn't stand out. For a main that costs $50, I was expecting something a bit more. My colleague ordered the risotto, and was very disappointed as well. It came in an extremely small and shallow bowl / plate, and he devoured it all in the matter of minutes. 

For dessert, we ordered two pairs of three desserts (from the four on the menu) to share:
Tiramisu - This dish barely resembled a tiramisu, and was more along the lines of a deconstructed dessert with a dark chocolate shell and mascarpone cream. It was interesting, but not what we were craving for and wanted.
Pizelle - This dessert stole the show, and was the best! The peach preserve and whipped cream made it appear deceivingly light (although you're well aware it's not, given all the dairy and richness). The presentation was also lovely; when the server poured the ganache over the top, the dessert was just imploring me to take photos!
Torta - I forgot the full name, but this chocolate hazelnut tart served with olive oil and squid ink just completely missed the mark. The olive oil imparted some savouriness to the dish, but the squid ink took it to a whole other level by adding some fishy essence. We left this largely untouched.

The wine assortment here is good, but also pricey (we paid ~$250 for a bottle of red, I believe). If I were to go to Buca again, I'd likely go to the King location for more of the earthy and meaty pasta choices. While this location was decent, it simply didn't meet expectations.",1
Stelvio,1,2019-07-06,"The service is terrible and the food is not good enough to make up for the awful service. The one good thing on the menu is the risotto with the veal shank, but everything else we ordered was just okay. The waitress we had didn't listen well enough and took too long doing everything. We weren't even there on a particularly busy night, so the lack of good service can't be blamed on how packed the restaurant was. I would save the money and settle for somewhere else instead.",0
Sugo,5,2020-02-24,"Oh yes padre. I have been salivating over this place for for quite some time now and when I was able to finally visit I was glad to see I wasn't disappointed!

My friend and I went on a Friday night at 5pm and to our delight there was no line up! Their dining area is very small and they don't do reservations. It's decorated with red and white table linens and there's a simple chalk menu board above where the cashier is. This area is for takeout orders. We sat down and our waitress came by to give us some advice about her favs which helped.

We got mozzarella sticks to start which was served with their signature sugo. They were super tasty. We also got a caesar salad. It was very fresh and super garlicky, just the way I like it! My friend got the gnocchi that came with their signature sugo (sauce) and I got chicken parmigiana with spaghetti in sugo. They gave me 2 pieces of chicken, and the mountain of spaghetti was HUGE. I seriously had leftovers for 2 meals after that. 

The chicken parmigiana was magnificent, tender and flavourful. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and sauce was deliziosa. I had some of my friend's gnocchi too and wish I got too because it was so tasty, light and fluffy little pillows of gnocchi heaven.

We got tiramisu afterwards to share for dessert. Honestly at this point I was surprised we were able to have anything else. The tiramisu was so good. A good portion and it was one of the best tiramisus I've ever had!

Can't wait to come back here for the other dishes!",2
Khao San Road,5,2020-01-10,"It's one of the best Thai places in Toronto and of I'm not mistaken better than Pai... *GASP* But also because they take American Express which means (all major credit cards, which to me seems like it's a dime a dozen these days)

ALSO, their portions are generous and it's worth the money you pay (they are on the more expensive side, but portion size makes up for it).

We ordered:

-Panama curry-- less curry and more of a dry curry type but freaking DELICIOUS 
-fried chicken- can't go wrong
-fried squash- the plate was twice the size of my head

And it was WAY MORE than enough for a large hungry man and my petite self.",2
Dumpling House Restaurant,5,2019-05-12,"Literally one of my favorite places we ate in Toronto! We stumbled upon this place in Chinatown and were not disappointed! 

The restaurant itself is small but they employees work quick to get food out fast! As you walk in, you can see the dumplings being made in the window and fried/steamed right there! The price was reasonable, the portions were huge, and the food was delicious! For two of us we definitely over ordered but could not decide what to eat and just got a bit of everything!

We ordered the fried pork dumplings, chicken fried noodles, and green onion pan cake! My favorite was the dumplings but you are at the House of Dumplings! Everything else was fantastic...we had to stop ourselves from licking the plates clean!

If in the area and visiting Chinatown, definitely check it out!!",2
Donatello Restaurant,3,2018-12-02,"Super average food with inflated prices. It's a small place so you have to make reservations even on a week night. 
The veggie pasta that I got (linguine with cream sauce and mushrooms) costed me 20 bucks without tax. The pasta was al dente which I liked but lacked much flavour. The portion size on the other hand was big. 
The calamari was also around $20 but was well cooked. I just wish we got more pieces :( They charred it nicely but by the time it made it to our table it was cold. 
The sever talked super fast but was friendly and happy. Not sure if I will return because I wasn't impressed with anything!",1
La Carnita,1,2020-02-16,"Worst service ever.  Staff don't care about the guests.  No table check. We had to hunt down a server to get a drink and order food. 

Cool vibe but would not recommend",0
Donatello Restaurant,3,2018-12-04,"Best crab ravioli & grilled calamari I've ever had! Friends ordered the veal marsala, a chicken special and fettuccine cream (don't remember the names) and they were flavourless. The restaurant is too cramped so it's hard to enjoy a meal without bumping elbows into the servers. Service however was really good. Would come back just for the ravioli & calamari.",1
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2017-06-23,"Dim sum in the heart of Yorkville, honestly coming from Richmond Hill (read: right beside Markham!) I wasn't expecting much. I expected average, bland tasting classics like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork bites wrapped in wonton-like skin). We arrived as a table of 7 on a weekday and the place was fairly empty - understandable, dim sum usually is a longer meal not favoured for a workday lunch hour. We ordered a bit of everything and some of us were looking for specific items - everyone found what they were looking for! There were a decent variety and many classics on the menu - some that aren't often found even in Markham because they're complex to make and don't sell for high prices.

The highlights were the fritter wrapped in rice roll, the osmanthus cake, and the mini octopus in curry sauce. Often the rice rolls are squishy and lack texture, but this one was a good consistency that complemented the crunchy (not chewy!) dough fritter. The osmanthus cake came with a base layer of coconut milk, providing additional flavour and texture that agreed with the table's demands for desserts that're not too sweet but still *something*. We also ordered steamed sponge cake - it was soft and fluffy, steaming hot. The realization the sponge cake was steamed baffled some, and the softness and light flavour was well received. It could've had more of the signature taste, but it was a decent attempt at the classic.

Overall for the location I was pleasantly surprised, and prices were aligned to the area as well. Unfortunately from a dim sum in Toronto perspective, I didn't feel like it was anywhere close to great and it definitely wasn't worth the price paid. Service was good and accommodating to the non-Chinese speakers, but translations were odd and made it more difficult to understand what things were in some cases. I'll be back for team lunches looking for exotic options and a group feeling because we're all at a round table, but aside that I'll stick with my suburb options.",1
Mariachi’s Restaurant,2,2018-06-29,"If you want to go for excellent customer service, go for it. Great people, great location. 

However, if you are going for the food. Skip this place and try something else. Food was mediocre, tasteless and expensive. I'm sorry but I wish I could go back in time and save myself $66.",0
Fudao noodle house,3,2019-04-29,"If you dine at Fudao, you should expect a very generous portion of food (due to their unlimited noodle refill) for an extremely reasonable price. However, what stops me from giving this place a higher rating is that I didn't find myself wanting more throughout the meal. 

I tried the Fudao rice noodle and thai curry and Teppan grill squid skewer. I expected the squid to have a nice grilled/smoky taste but when it came to the table, it appeared to have just been boiled(?) and dipped in sauce. The rice noodle dish presentation is pleasant at first, but then you have to dump all the sides immediately into the boiling pot in order to have everything cooked properly. Once this is done, it becomes just like any other noodle dish. The meat was actually surprisingly soft/tender but only 3 pieces will come with the meal.

Regardless, Fudao does seem to be a popular restaurant in Toronto and was packed when I came, so perhaps it's worth a visit. Personally though, if I was back in town, I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I just wanted to get full for a cheap price.",1
Sugo,5,2019-08-06,"After a 2 hour wait time, we sat down for a carb heavy meal and every bite was delicious! 

My BF bet his friends they couldn't finish a meal on their own (both of them did.)  haha We shared a meal between us and were both FULL. Great value if you don't bet your friends and end up paying for the whole table Haha!

Blasting music and wine flowing it made for a fun atmosphere!  We'll be back! :) 

We did the Veal Parm & Spaghetti  Apparently it's all homemade.",2
Buca,3,2019-09-30,"The pasta is really good. You can tell it's homemade once you take a bite. However, prices are quite high with portion sizes small. I ordered the duck pasta and felt I wanted more pasta but I guess it's filling but I don't think it's worth the price. I love my desserts but all their desserts were over $15 so I passed. The service was good and attentive.

They do not do separate cheques. Therefore, if you come with a large group be prepared to grab your calculators so you can split the bill easier. I'm a little annoyed that the host never checked me in with my open table reservation which resulted in a warning email from Open Table for a No Show. He did resolve it after the phone call but it was quite inconvenient to have to call the restaurant to have them fix the problem.",1
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,2,2018-12-05,"Sotto Sotto has been on my list for a long time and I was happy to be able to dine there recently.

The waiter kept asking us repeatedly if we want sparkling water and we had to tell him at least 3-4 times that we don't. Finally we got our actual drinks and wanted to place the food order. For some reason, the waiter stopped coming to our table. We witnessed other tables order and eat their appetizers and order and get their entrees while we got no service. Finally after being in the restaurant for over 30 minutes (and not placed an order yet) my wife had enough and left the table to find the manager. During this time, the waiter came to our table and said ""I saw you were talking, I didn't want to interrupt you"" which is a rather odd excuse - were we supposed to sit in silence to get serviced?

My wife returned with the manager who was a class act and we got assigned another waiter who was attentive and fantastic for the rest of the night. We decided to share the risotto. I'm not claiming to be expert in Italian food despite being in Italy for over 10 times, but the rice was simply too hard. I'm aware of the fact that you're not supposed to overcook it to a point where it's mushy but too hard is too hard. I was hoping to eat Italian food that's spectacular but it was actually below average and very pricey.",0
Ho Ho Barbeque,5,2018-04-21,"I went on a Friday late afternoon, and the staffs were eating. They quickly greeted me and got up to ask what I wanted to get. It was a surprisingly awesome experience at this small Chinese bbq shop!

I order 2 items combo rice of roasted pork and bbq pork, as well as half a duck and it came out to be a little over $20 including tax. What a steal for the quality and portion! While I was waiting, one of the staff offered me to sample their bbq pork..what great service!

I wish I lived close by and I'll definitely patron more often!",2
Carisma,3,2019-02-12,"I have frequently gone by this restaurant, and was curious to try it out. I dined here for a business meeting with several of my colleagues.

The ambiance and decor is elegant and romantic overall, and the staff are very welcoming and hospitable.

Carisma has been an establishment in Toronto for years, and I was eager to try it out based on recommendations.

Upon entering, I was greeted by very hospitable staff. The restaurant was entirely empty upon my arrival, which I found to be unusual given that it was peak dinner time.

Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and had great recommendations about specials that evening and the menu. 

My colleague and I decided to share the Grilled Calamari appetizer, which was quite flavorful in nature with the addition of olives and herbs. Although I didn't partake in the bread, my colleague mentioned that it was quite soft and delicious overall!

For our entrees, we ordered the SeaBass Filet which according to my companion was well-seasoned and delicious overall; another colleague asked for a 'surprise' entree and was presented with a combined dish of the gnocchi and agnolotti, which she enjoyed. My entree was the ahi tuna dish which I was excited about; however, I must admit that this was overdone. It was presented as an entire tuna steak, which was likely the issue in the cook overall, as had it been sliced tuna, there may have been more control over the cook. I had asked for it to be rare, and it was far more than well-done, and even charred on one side. 

Overall, I am glad that I tried this establishment. I commend the staff and service for their efforts.",1
El Charro,2,2020-04-18,"I added this to my list based on good Yelp reviews. We ordered a takeaway - burrito, quesadilla and corn chips. Overall the food was not fresh, the burrito was average and quesadilla lacked any flavor. Corn chips were overly salty and guac was not fresh. I will try again...",0
Ramen Isshin,4,2020-01-15,"Food - I'm a big fan of Spicy Miso so of course I had to get that. This place is known for their spicy miso so, as you can imagine, it's really good. Their broth is rich, tasty, and has a kick to it; I LOVE IT. The noodles and condiments are pretty normal but it's still good. The ramen doesn't come with an egg though so you have to order extra for that. We had the takoyaki and gyoza too. The takoyaki was really good, it's deep fried so the outside is crispy while the inside remains juicy; not convention, I know but its good. Gyoza was pretty good too!

Ambiance - It's a relatively small restaurant with limited seats so be sure to plan ahead if you're coming in as a big group. Aside from that, everything's pretty clean and has a typical ramen shop interior.

Price - my bowl of ramen was around $16 without egg. I thought it was expensive...but its good so maybe its worth it? 

Service - Our host was pretty nice and attentive. Despite the restaurant being busy l, we were still given everything in an orderly manner. 

Overall - Great place if you're a fan of Miso style broth. I heard the other ramen spots might be better if you're not really into miso though!",2
Eataly,1,2020-02-21,"OK
in life we are allowed to change our minds.
This place is so CONGESTED and FRUSTRATING.
You had to know it would be a success!???  Rent the whole building out!?  A claustrophobic maze getting in and out of here..  want a coffee/espresso upstairs; FORGET about it; I've been 8 times; only twice was the line under a dozen people, it's good but the line is too long.  Some of the worst cashiers at pizza line; chatting, hugging, orders wrong... I don't think I like this place anymore.",0
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2019-06-18,"My friend and I were in the area, craving Chinese food, and didn't want to walk too far, so we came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant is nice on the inside and well kept. The waitstaff are friendly enough and pretty attentive. The food is pretty overpriced though and lacks flavor.

My friend ordered the green onion pancake and wonton soup. I had the spicy beef noodle soup. The green onion pancake was average, but the wonton soup broth had pretty good flavor. There were only three small wontons though, which my friend wasn't happy about. I wish the beef noodle soup had some flavor - it tasted like spicy and mildly salty water, which was surprising given how rich the soup looked. The noodles had a nice springy-ness to them, and there was A LOT of beef. I usually complain there isn't enough beef in my noodle soups, but I couldn't finish all the beef in my soup this time!

I'd consider taking friends here if they've only grown up on burgers their whole life and want to try Asian cuisine (maybe bring some spice packets along...), but I would not recommend this place to people who want authentic Chinese food. Take a 25 minute walk to Spadina Avenue instead.",1
Mexico Lindo,3,2017-06-02,"I was really excited for this place because it had been such a long time since I've had Mexican food. While everything tasted great I was slightly disappointed by the mediocre serving sizes. And warning that the complimentary salsa is very spicy! Also, not that it's the restaurant's fault, but there's a huge sidewalk planter right in front of the entrance which made it pretty much impossible for our stroller to go through. A wheelchair would definitely not be able to pass so heads up. Otherwise seems like a casual and family-friendly place.",1
Baretto Caffe,2,2019-09-18,"I was so looking forward to trying this place out based on all the Yelp reviews and I'm sad to say, my experience here was not a good one.  The cafe is so quaint and located inside a non-descript office building with a cute Koi pond to the side.  

There were 3 people working during a busy-ish lunch time and it took them 15+ min to just take our order.  My daughter's cheese pizza came out first with extra sprinkling of Parmesan cheese which she hates.  It would have been nice to know that even a cheese pizza would come showered in Parmesan.  My husband's lasagna took 30 min to arrive with the same amount of Parmesan on top.  You can see the amount of Parmesan on the photos below.  This was perhaps the best dish of the day still.  The lasagna had a nice meaty sauce and was definitely a pre-made lasagna that was reheated which made us wonder why it would take 30 min to just reheat and serve a premade lasagna.  My fettucine primavera also came doused in too much Parmesan in a tomato sauce that was way too watery and sweet.  Let's just say my pasta was beyond disappointing.  

Based on this experience, I am not sure if I would return here any time soon.",0
Playa Cabana,5,2017-09-18,"Love this place! I had a mad craving for tacos one day, so I took a detour on my way home from work and stopped in for some Mexican fare. 

Obviously, I'm not Mexican and I have actually never even been to Mexico, so I'm definitely not qualified to speak about the authenticity of the food here, but I most certainly can comment on the flavours and presentation of the food. My opinion is WOW... just Wow. Seriously delicious food. I had the octopus tacos, guacamole with chips and finished off with crab cakes. I also had a beer, but in hindsight I should've had a margarita instead. They looked delicious! 

I tried a few different hot sauces, and boy, were they good! A couple were a bit too hot for me, but I enjoyed trying them. I put a couple of drops of each one onto the guacamole as I devoured it, so I could see which one I liked best. 

The octopus tacos were perfection. I should've ordered double and skipped the crab cakes, as they were not as enjoyable for me. The guacamole was fantastic and I loved the house made chips. 

Service was exceptional. I sat at the bar on my own and everyone was extremely friendly and I felt very welcome. Oftentimes, when dining solo, I feel a bit out of place or ignored. Not the case here. It seemed that the staff really went out of their way to make me feel at ease and ensure that I had a good experience. What a difference this makes in a dining experience. 

Can't wait to go back for more tacos!!",2
Carisma,5,2019-08-06,"Fine Italian dining. Valued accordingly, but you certainly get what you pay for and the service was fantastic (as was the food). At our table the wild boar ragu pasta, sea bass and risotto were favourites. Our selections of Osso buco and delicate fish fillets perfectly prepared and flavored. The restaurant filled up as show time approached but we hardly noticed - not overly noisy despite being full by the time we departed. The food and service were both exceptional. Carisam is our number one choice for Italian food in Toronto. Sophisticated, elegant and classic. Love this place!",2
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,3,2019-10-18,"We ordered dim sums. They were all very good. But the service was a little slow: we had to ask twice for some tea, twice for the bill, and never got the sauce we asked for. It looks like no waiter in particular was in charge of our table.",1
Carisma,3,2019-07-04,"Not feeling it for the new fancy location.

Love the old location with old friendly staff than the new ones.  The price is more expensive, and the food is not as good.  The new staff didn't know about serving / dinner etiquette.  Serving both left and right side.  With the lower food quality and higher price tag / seemed more fancy environment will look for more.  The owner is still there and he has to work hard and busy himself by telling the new younger staff what needs to be done.

Really disappointing that the food was not as good as before (far from it).",1
Enoteca Sociale,2,2019-07-27,I came here and had a short male server with a buzz cut and glasses that was very rude.,0
King’s Tacos,3,2019-05-18,The food quality and quantity is good. They are making the fresh food for the right price. One thing they need to improve is the cleanliness of the plates and cutlery. Nice spot for Mexican food.,1
Nodo Restaurant,3,2018-12-23,"It's ok. It's definitely not 4.5 lol. 

We got the prosciutto and ricotta fritters to start and those were great. Took a little too long to come out but they were redeeming. 

We got the oreciette (sp?) and duck tagliatelle and both fell short in different areas. The duck tagliatelle was definitely missing some flavour notes - probably lacking in aromatics- maybe garlic? Something was missing. The pasta was also way overdone for a restaurant and not al dente at all. It needed a lot more salt- and even though I got piles of parmesan on it, it was still under salted. 

The oreciette to me was the better of the two- the pasta was perfectly al dente and the chilli component made the taste better, but it was still missing something- hard to say what.

The tables adjacent to us seemed to really like their food so maybe it was just us.

We didn't get dessert so I can't speak for that. 

I would maybe come back and try to gnocchi but other than that, nothing really sparked my interest.",1
Mexico Lindo,2,2017-10-25,"The decor is nice and the atmosphere feels right, but this place lacked a bit of service attention. 

We dropped by for a quick bite as we love Mexican food. We ended up ordering the fajitas for two. It was a large portion of meat (we got chicken and chorizo mix) but there were only 5 (five) tiny tortillas... that didn't make sense to me. 2 or us, lots of meat, but very few tortillas...we asked and we had to pay to get more, which I thought was not reasonable. I didn't get more cause I'm cheap. Also, we got a tiny container of sour cream. 

Overall it felt like they offered very little in terms of condiments. 
I waited a good 5-10 minutes to get more napkins and some hot sauce (Something good and spicy) but no luck. I ended up getting up and walking to the front to ask for it. Overall the service wasn't great. 
The fajitas were good but nothing out of this world. The selection of Mexican beers was also limited. 
We will have to keep looking for the ultimate Mexican Food place!",0
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,2,2017-12-17,"Last week, I decided to get take out from a nearby restaurant. They said it would take twenty minutes, so I decided to walk around instead of waiting at the restaurant. I had killed some time and by the time I had looped around, I thought hey maybe I can grab one of my favorite treats as dessert. Dynasty was right there, so I went upstairs, proceeded to the counter, looked at their priceless* dim sum menu and ordered one order of the steamed egg yolk custard buns.

I said priceless with an * because I wanted to explain that it didn't have a price next to the items... Not because there menu is super precious. Boy did I ever experience sticker shock. Yes, I do remember Dynasty is over priced and the food is average here. But when I paid over $10 for three tiny buns...I couldn't help but think: didn't I pay just four dollars for three of these, but slightly larger ones, at Rol San a few weeks ago? 

Okay, so maybe the quality is why it's priced higher, I thought. So after eating amazing Indian food for dinner, I dug into the custard buns. The filing is kinda dry... Atop of this, there's some weird film/coating around the ""custard""/yolk. I assume it's edible, because it's in all three, and I ate it. But if I had to compare it against other custard buns that I've had... I'd much prefer a creamy custard instead of something dried up. I don't think of custards as something dried up ever.

There was a time when the buns were good here... Years ago. Its a shame because the other items in the menu here really are average and over priced.",0
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2018-08-10,"Dimmi was ok but it wasn't anything special. My husband, daughter and I were in Toronto for a quick family vacation. After sight seeing we went to Yorkville to shop. Of course all of the shopping made us hungry. We walked up and down the street to find something to eat. We finally decided on Dimmi. I had a taste for pasta and thought this would be a good choice. It was pretty busy but there was no wait. The staff was very nice and accommodating.

When we first got there my husband and I ordered drinks. He got a Old-Fashioned and I got a Sangria. He enjoyed his drink. My drink started off good but then started to taste like medicine the more I drank it. Needless to say I didn't finish it.

We started our dinner with ordering the Kale as an appetizer. Of course this was a side salad. It consisted of shaved kale with pinenuts and cranberries covered with pecorino cheese in a lemon and olive oil dressing. This salad was very good. The flavors were nice and most of all I enjoyed the pinenuts. They added a nice crunch to the dish. 

For our entrees I ordered the STRO ZZAPRETI ALLA ERNESTO and my husband ordered the Roasted Chicken Breast. My dish consisted of spicy nduja sausage, rapini and cherry tomatoes in garlic and olive oil. This was something different for me but good. The sausage added a nice hint of heat but not too spicy. The pasta was good. It also had cherry tomatoes and spinach. I could have done without the spinach. I like spinach in salads or creamed spinach but I don't like plain cooked down spinach. The texture is odd in my opinion. Other than that this dish was good.  My husband's dish came with vegetables and roasted potatoes. The chicken was pretty tender but flavorless. The whole plate was flavorless for that matter. It was very bland and needed seasoning. My husband ate it but he wasn't thrilled. 

Last, we ended our meal with a dessert. We ordered the Apple Crumble. It came out in a slice but instead of pie crust topping it had a crumble topping. It came with a scoop of ice cream. This dish was decent. It was pretty tasty. It's one of those things that is wasn't bad but it wasn't the best we have had. 

Overall, Dimmi was ok. We enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special.",1
El Nahual Tacos,5,2019-09-02,"Delicious tacos. I appreciated the 3 for $13 special. 

It's nice that this place is in a Food Hall, so that my husband and I could experience food from multiple places.",2
El Nahual Tacos,3,2019-11-13,"I got the 6inch shrimp burrito -- definitely not the best burrito I've ever had but it wasn't bad either. I enjoyed it but was disappointed when they said they didn't have any hot sauce?!! You also can't choose toppings either, I'm pretty sure all the burritos comes with the same thing (rice + peppers and onions) Again, tasted good didn't mind that at all but I think my extreme hunger made it taste a lot better, if that makes any sense. I probably won't be back but glad I got to try this place out!!! Maybe if I had tried the tacos my opinion would be different but you can def find better taco places I'm sure",1
Xola Mexican Food,5,2018-05-27,"Absolutely the best Mexican restaurant in Toronto... The other comments stating the same fact are true. The chef and family cook with heart and the result is pure authentic Mexican food that is definitely top class. We tried the steak taco and duck confit... Our taste buds were having a feista on their own. 

Highly recommend this restaurant and will come back for repeat visits.",2
Giulietta,3,2019-05-19,"Had my bday dinner at the counter seating in front of the kitchen, a great spot to watch the chef cooking the dishes. Food was great except the pasta. It's raw, not Al dente. We ordered the octopus. The portion size of each piece has a quite big difference. Wonder if they give s bigger portion for a large table. As we only had two people, we ordered the pork chop instead of the porterhouse. It's lovely cooked with cheeky pink inside. The highlight was the dessert, pine nut tart with wildflower honey and vanilla mascarpone. It's not too sweet with balanced flavour. 
The kitchen gave us a piece of choco tarte as bday cake. It's funny that the candle light was off three times as it's windy above our seats. 
I'd love to try their pizza in the future. However I doubt if I will go again coz they don't seem like to chat with asians",1
Blu Ristorante,3,2019-09-15,"I'm really not trying to be passive aggressive but honestly, this is my interpretation of this restaurant and the patrons who have rated it so highly.  I feel it received the acclamation it has (voted one of most romantic restaurants in the city and all the 5 star ratings) because (a)  it's in Yorkville and (b) guests MAY mostly include those that don't dine out in the city as often.  The ones that usually do on special occasions

Look, this city has an abundance of fantastic restaurants led by a generation of daring, creative and exciting chefs.  So when I come to Blu, that is a self proclaimed ""fine dining"" restaurant, I'm expecting everything to be elevated.  Not everyone can be Alo, I get it, but it's the expectation that's set which I'm comparing the experience to.  

For starters we got carpaccio, tuna tartar and the octopus. The carpaccio was your typical combination of flavors that I can recite in my sleep (meet, Capers, some creamy sauce, truffle oil ,arugula for garnish.  Maybe not exactly but you know what I mean).  The tartar was tasty from what I recall but the ""octopus"" omg.  First off they seemed to be 2 squid tentacles, very small and burnt.  On one side is a pineapple chutney of sorts and on the other side is an eggplant purée.  It's octopus! Can't really mess that up and don't ever pair is with anything so overpowering. The eggplant ok fine maybe but the Indian flavors did not complement the fish at all.  

On to main course.  My wife had the wild boar ragu.  First couple of bites and you're thinking wow this is delicious but I could see where my wife was coming from when she said the sweetness in that dish is just too much.  You almost get sick of it near the end.  But she ate most of it and whatever it was fine.  I had the seafood pasta.  It was good.  Fresh seafood, pasta and light olive oil sauce.  Nothing extra just what you'd expect I guess.  

The ambiance is great and we loved the service.  They have a nice drink menu and prices were what you'd expect for Yorkville.  

Overall is was a great night and my wife and I didn't leave the restaurant angry.  We enjoyed the food but again it's setting the expectation.  Everything we ate tasted like how they should and we've had those same flavors many times before.  but we were expecting more imagination with flavors and presentation.

Mi Taco Taqueria,2,2019-06-28,"In retrospect, it might have been a mistake to order a burrito from a taco joint.

But I'm a burrito guy; I would easily say it's one of my favorite foods ever, so if I spot it on a menu, I'm almost certainly ordering it.

And so it was that I found myself placing an order for a Carne Asada Burrito with all the fixins (including guacamole, which I paid extra for) on a recent Thursday evening.

After a wait of about 10 minutes, my burrito was ready to eat and I knew I had made a mistake with the very first bite. That first taste contained only plain iceberg lettuce and, worse still, it was almost ice cold. Yikes.

As I continued eating, I did begin to taste the Carne Asada and other ingredients and they are, to put it mildly, nothing special. There are virtually no bold flavors to be had here, and though I had asked for the spiciest level of heat, the burrito was surprisingly, disappointing bland.

The meat itself was chewy and unspectacular, too. The whole thing just tasted of a complete and total lack of effort, ultimately.

I might return to try one of Mi Taco's, uh, tacos, but I can't see myself ever ordering another burrito - especially when the far, far superior Burrito Boyz is just around the corner. (Heck, the nearby Mucho Burrito makes a better product!)",0
Swatow Restaurant,3,2019-08-03,"One of the OG restaurants of Toronto's Chinatown. It is a classic ""hole in the wall"" that has stood the test of time. The surrounding area is slowly but surely undergoing gentrification.  I remember a lot more Chinese supermarkets and aunties selling vegetables and other items along the streets. 

The restaurant is small and cramped. If you have a seat near the kitchen doors, be prepared for the stench every time the door swings open. You don't come here for the ambiance/service. You come here for Chinese food. 

Washrooms are in the basement, as with most restaurants in the area. 

Service is as expected from a Chinese restaurant. Effective. 

Ordered:
""Fish sliced noodle soup"": I chose vermicelli, which is thin rice noodles. The ""fish sliced"" is actually a blend of mystery fish made into a cube pre-cooked and sliced. It's probably the same item used for hotpot. Instead of this topping, I'd recommend the fish balls (you really taste the ""fishiness""). 

The soup is clear and very mild in flavour. It's not overly salty. A plus is the vegetables that accompany the soup. 

Observing the other tables' chow meins, rice dishes etc., I believe Markham Chinese food / Congee Queens provide much better value (quantity:price ratio)",1
Juicy Dumpling,5,2020-02-20,"If you want something quick and fast, and you want soup dumplings. This is the place to go. They serve food like it is fast food but the quality is perfect.
You order your food at the counter, the menu is limited but worth trying everything. The prices are really cheap as well, and as for the quality, the soup dumplings were pretty good. 
After you order your food they give you a buzzer, as I would call it. You take a sit and wait for the buzzer to vibrate. You grab your food, get your condiments and bon appetite. 
So if you are in the area and want some fast soup dumpling, definitely check this place out. Will be worth your time.",2
Carisma,1,2019-10-20,"- Not worth for its price. Both service and quality of food. 
- Pappardelle very hard not fully cooked
- Risotto hard as well 
- In this city when there are so many Italian restaurants to compete with, this type of quality simply unacceptable. 
- The lady who served us seemed very unhappy and no smile during the whole dining period.  At the end of the mains, she wiped the dinning table but did such a sloppy job that all crumbles fell on my lap.  I do not know the purpose of doing it. 
- the ""supervisor"" or the manager walked around the room and consciously or subconsciously patted our velvet lounge chair to tell us hurry up cause we might have chatted too long and eating too slow.  
Overall, we are a group of three and we picked this place for our Japanese friend's visit for our first time. None of us would return again.  Pure disappointment.",0
La Vecchia Ristorante,1,2018-08-23,"This place has been on my list of must-try restaurants in the Yonge-Eg area for quite some time (mostly because of all the high Yelp reviews). However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience. Cleanliness is a really big deal to me, and the restaurant did not feel very clean. There were a LOT of flies buzzing around my table, to the point that I had to swat my hand in between every single bite and was afraid one would fly into my mouth (ew!). The bread was cold, and the pasta was mediocre and at a higher price point. The waiter could see me constantly waving my hand to get the flies out of my face and made no comment. I was not impressed.",0
Jacobs & Co. Steakhouse,5,2019-12-22,"Wide range of steaks, that takes your tastebuds for a journey around the world: Japan, US, Australia and even Ontario towns like Uxbridge and Guelph. We dined in the wine cellar, which has a clear wall peaking into the wine cellar and facing opposite their aging room.

First image:
Wagyu (bottom), Guelph (top) with black volcanic salt, miso salt (brown) and sea salt. Each salt had a distinct flavour adding a unique twist to any steak. Sauces were fresh and diverse, chimichurri was my favourite for its fresh ""just picked"" herb taste, Japanese ponzu was a touch too salty, and the Danish blue cheese and bacon (I did not sample)

It's definitely not an everyday dinner, but for a corporate Christmas party or special occasion, Jacobs is a crowd pleasing spot for a delicious meal in a space that encourages learning the story of your meal.",2
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2020-01-27,"The barbecue meat here is really good, juicy and tender. I normally get the lunch boxes here, and it's very hit and miss here.
I made the mistake of coming here 1.5 hours before they closed. They ran out of veggies, but still had plenty of meat left.

If you get the young dude cutting your meat, you're gonna get much less meat in your box. he's pretty stingy. and I've gone here 3 times, and every time he cut my meat, I got either bad cuts, or very little.

I've gotten roasted duck rice before, and he gives you the bones and rib area, with one piece of breast so you have one piece with meat.

Today I got 2 boxes, No veggies were left. I got 6 pieces of bbq pork and 5 pieces of roasted pork. and whole box load of rice. was so disappointed! barely any toppings, and they had plenty of meat left!! not like they were running out.

argh! the only part I can't complain is it's 6.50 a box and comes with either soup or a can of pop.

Pro tip, come early, otherwise don't come. and hope it's not the young dude cutting your meat.",1
DaiLo,3,2019-11-23,"Very pricey very small portions but good atmosphere, services is pretentious but ok. Good place for drinks and what feels like tapas.  Good place for an expensive date, most plates enough for 2 ppl only. 

Plates to try: fried rice, whole fried fish, jelly slaw, 

Plates to skip: fried watermelon sound cool but just warm cubes of water lemon, ribeye (meat was tough), duck meat was also tough, 

We ordered 3/4 of their small menu. They don't have all the items pictures on yelp. 

They have an excellent bottle of white wine, Chasselas I think from France? Yum. 

BEWARE: we found that the prices they charged on our bill was different and higher than the prices listed on their menu ??!! Shady right??! How does that even happen?? Our bottle of wine was listed for $75 and they charged $85 and a few other other items too, $38 listed charged $40 etc.  We verified the wine and they admitted their fault.  We let the other smaller differences go but SHADY BUSINESS PRACTICE OR INCOMPETENCE?! 

Just REMEMBER TO CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL. ITS SO EXPENSIVE ALEADY so I guess most people just assumed it was accurate.",1
Terroni,3,2020-01-31,"We made resos for a Thursday night. Boy was this place packed! I liked the ambiance but felt like it was too noisy. I liked how it was dimly lit. 
I ordered the duck ravioli. Portion size seemed small. Sauce was good but I felt like it was missing something salty! 
My friend ordered the spicy sausage pasta which was tasty as well. She said it was al dente and the pieces of meat were good. It wasn't too salty or saucy.  
The complimentary bread was mediocre. It was cold and came in a folded paper basket. A small bowl of olive oil was hidden underneath. The olive oil was delishhh though! 
Overall it was alright. Prices are reasonable for the quality. I'm not sure if I'd go back again though!",1
House of Gourmet,3,2019-07-22,"(SKIPTHEDISHES Delivery Review)

My friend and I decided to order delivery on a Saturday morning. 
They have a HUGE menu and it was actually a little confusing for indecisive me to find something I could decide on.

We ended up getting:
1. Pork & Preserved Egg Congee: My friend really enjoyed this
2. Minced Beef Congee: The congee came to my apartment HOT (yay) and it was really well made in my opinion. There was a good amount of beef and I liked the amount of ginger in there to give it extra flavor (and it makes me feel 'healthier'
3. Dough Sticks: These were still warm when it arrived. Fairly standard but still a positive that it made it to the apartment without being soggy
4. Rice rolls with Shrimp & Soy Sauce: Never ordering these again. The shrimp didn't seem like it was fresh. The rice rolls were really chewy and plasticky instead of being soft and silky. For $7 the portions were TINY. 

For those 4 very basic things it came to about $27 (not including delivery charge).

I used to come here when I was really little with my grandma as her temple is right next door. I'd come back just to see how it compares in person.",1
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,4,2019-11-26,"Came here with a group of my friends. This is definitely a great place to take someone who isn't from toronto. The mountain of lobsters makes for a great photo op! But not only does it make for great IG photos the food is also very good here! 

For a table of 8 people we got the lobster and king crab combo that was cooked in 3 ways. I definitely recommend having it cooked different ways otherwise just eating a 30 lb lobster just fried will get tiring and boring fairly fast. We got it cooked fried, steamed stir fried but I must say my favourite was the fried and the soy glazed one! So flavourful and yummy. 

They give you gloves to eat with so you don't have to dirty your hands. The food comes very quickly. Our table barely had enough room for everything. The meal also came with fish and fried rice. The fried rice was okay but tbh we were all too focused on the good stuff. 

We had a lot of left overs and the meal definitely could have fed at least 3-4 more people. It was a very expensive dinner. The combo itself was $1088 if I remembered correctly. 

Service was okay. Parking is a mess there! Definitely so early to get a spot.",2
King’s Tacos,4,2019-05-21,"Tacos! Love tacos and loved the flavour of the fillings for the tacos here. 

The only thing I wish they did is being able to mix the tacos choices so you could try more of them without going overboard with the meal sizes. Also feel like because of this the prices are a little more than some other taco spots. 

However overall the tacos are great! Had an enjoyable experience. Side note: the churros are massive.",2
Buca Yorkville,3,2019-11-03,"The food was good. But nothing amazing. We ordered the branzino it was good showed us the fished carved it table side. Great presentation.  Unfortunately it tasted like it was drowned in oil and lacked other flavours. We also ordered cured fish. Most of them tasted good some of them just tasted fishy.

The service wasn't bad. Over it was good had to try pretty hard to get our server a few times.  

Also they have a fruit fly problem inside.  Nov 2019. Half way through our meal we went from having one fly to 10. It wasn't pleasant.  The server were kind enough to move us to a different table and comp us 2 glasses of wine. But still wasn't what I would expect in this type of establishment.",1
Byblos,2,2019-08-09,"Food was nothing special and food took a while to come out. We had the fried chicken - which lacked flavour nothing too great to be raves about. As sides we ordered the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts - which basically tasted like boiled vegetables which also lacked flavours. 
Overall wasn't super impressed, the only thing nice was really the inside of the restaurant with the aesthetics

Carisma,4,2019-04-30,"This restaurant had nice modern decor and comfortable seating. I went with a group of 9 people and they gave us a large table that was sectioned off so we had some privacy. 

Food wise I would say was ok, like 3.5/5 stars. This is because the portions seemed very small. The calamari appetizer tasted good, mushroom salad appetizer was good but not worth the price in my opinion, the complimentary bread was a bit burnt and too crunchy, the mozarella with tomato wasn't worth the price and was too simple ... For the main course I got the chicken (first item on the menu under secondi). It came with two large pieces of white and dark meat with potatoes, a grilled lemon on top, and some veggies. This was worth the price because of the amount of meat that was given. A few people at my table ordered the gnocchi which looked very plain when it arrived, but tasted ok. The gnocchi is the same price as the chicken and I would say the chicken is worth more. 

Overall, Iikely won't return often to this restaurant due to the portion sizes, however if I had to pick a few items to have again it would be the calamari appetizer and the chicken dish as the main course.",2
Quetzal,3,2019-12-03,"I was very excited about trying Quetzal. Upon arrival the ambiance was great, with candlelit tables and a curved ceiling, like being inside of a ship. The bar seating was inviting and the drinks menu was inventive and cocktails were superior with great notes for sipping.

For the food we did the tasting menu, since there were many unique dishes that we wanted to try. The sea bream and scallop ceviche was underwhelming, with the scallops being were quite small and not fresh tasting. The other sushi grade fish - the kanpchi tiradito - was good in comparison. The thin crispy Masa round was similar to a taco pizza, and a fun app to share. 

Next up, the kale salad was tasty and served with the full stems. The bone marrow came with two large bones but didn't seem to have enough flavour cooked into it. Lastly, the skirt steak and 18oz rib eye were served. We were never asked how we liked it cooked when ordering, but we received medium rare which worked out to our tastes. 

Overall, great value for a lot of food and high quality ingredient based dishes, but nothing stood out at the end of the night. I was hoping for a little more bite. 

It's a beautiful restaurant otherwise, and maybe I'm just not the right fit for palette.",1
Magical Taste of China,1,2019-08-17,"This place is not as good as expected because of the following reasons:

1. Shredded lamb with pancakes were dry and not fresh and portions for the lamb skewers were extremely small compared to some other tables. They should have equal portion sizes for all customers. 
2. The Western Chinese lamb rice is a strange combination of what seemed like sweet potato and the rice was clumped together. It did not taste good. 
3. The membership system is ridiculous as the normal prices have a huge difference for each item listed on the menu. They should provide members to have a discount over the total bill instead. 
4. My friend had food poisoning shortly after leaving the restaurant.

For these reasons, I would be reluctant to come back as there are many places that offer much better quality and portions.",0
El Catrin Destileria,3,2020-02-01,"El Catrin is good! Located in the heart of Toronto's Distillery District, it prides itself on its traditional Mexican-style cuisine in a casual, yet oh-so-slightly-upscale atmosphere.

The interior is very tastefully decorated and the restaurant features a large outdoor patio equipped with giant space heaters for colder days.

I went to El Catrin for lunch and tried the Pepito torta while my companion had the Huevos Rancheros. The steak sandwich was really well marinated and super tender. Go for it! Oh, and we had the tableside-made guacamole with the tortilla chips (which turned out to be pretty excellent). You should go for that as well.

There aren't too many great options for food near Corktown/Distillery District, so give El Catrin a try next time you're around.",1
Fieramosca,2,2019-07-04,"It is on the $$ side so I expected a great meal. I ordered Spaghetti Carbonara. I can't believe the fatty bacon in this dish. I basically picked out all of the bacon grizzle and ate the spaghetti which, aside from the bacon was good. 

The atmosphere in this establishment is uptight. The tables are too close together, you feel crammed in. It did not make for a very relaxed evening.",0
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,2,2017-04-26,"This is yet another restaurant in Chinatown which specializes in homemade dumplings and Northern Chinese cuisine. 

I came here only because Yummy Dumplings was closed for lunch on Wednesday, so I ended up here to satisfy my dumpling cravings. 

I ordered the pork & chives dumplings (boiled) which was so so. The skin was thicker than I'm used to but still acceptable & you get 16 dumplings for $7.99. The XLB soup dumplings came next. It was presented in the usual bamboo steamer and you get 10 small bite size pieces. It certainly wasn't my favourite because the skin was thick & some seemed under cooked. The pork filling was okay but the soup content wasn't very consistent. Some were not replete with soup when biting into them and overall wasn't very satisfying. Also it's typically served with some fresh ginger on the side to make your dipping sauce but they don't here. Maybe their Xian style dishes are what they are best known for but it certainly wasn't the dumplings.",0
Greedy Duck & Noodles,2,2019-04-29,"Maybe I didn't know what to expect but the wings are served cool and are mostly skin and bone. Did not do it for me. The noodles were hot and flavorful but the sesame texture is quite chalky and I didn't find myself wanting to eat more than a few big bites full. Mostly just noodles, a little sauce and some garnish.",0
Mexico Lindo,5,2019-03-09,"Amazing!! Family run, authentic, delicious food, competitive pricing and great portions! Love that they offer courtesy chips and homemade salsa!

Enoteca Sociale,5,2019-12-17,"I was here over the weekend for a romantic dinner. The staff are lovely and the service was great. Amazing dishes, I highly recommend building your own charcuterie board. It's intimate and candlelit. When I made my reservation, they were very accommodating and replied quickly with answers to my questions.",2
Eataly,2,2020-01-14,"We ate at the Le Pizza La Pasta restaurant. 

I would have given this place 4/5 if it weren't for what happened with our billing/menu.

We came in on a Tuesday night. Put our name in and had a walk around for 40-45 minutes. Overall the food was good. We ordered a pasta and a pizza along with the Burutta as an appetizer. The bread came with some really tasty olive oil. The pizza was excellent with generous toppings. I found our pasta good but not great. 

WHAT WENT WRONG: The menu had the Burutta for $8. When the receipt came - I did a quick glance and paid the bill. However the total came up higher than I thought it would be I went back to look at the receipt. The Burutta showed up as $18. I did a double take on a new menu from the front desk to make sure it said $8. My server was elsewhere by now. I went to the front to ask the hostess who at this point basically dismissed me with a chuckle that the menu was ""printed wrong"". I was in a rush so left but I would have definitely taken this up with the manager.

I really think they should have just fixed their menu (even just pencilled it in), or warned me it was a pricing error when I ordered.",0
Levetto,2,2017-11-28,"I really wanted to like this place. I've had it bookmarked for ages as I love Italian food but I don't go downtown often so I saved it for a day when I was in the area. 
Anyways that day finally came and I went for my favourite Margarita pizza. But the excitement fizzled as soon as I saw my food. It looked sad. The crust looked crispy but when I bite into it, it was doughy and almost underdone. There was very little ingredients on the pizza and dough to ingredient ration was seriously off. I'm thinking I probably just went at the wrong time on the wrong day but still.... I've literally been waiting over a year to try this place with rad reviews. Honestly disappointed. I didn't even finish it.",0
Ho Ho Barbeque,4,2019-02-23,"Taste: Amazing and authentic. Definitely 5/5 on this. I mostly order bbq pork but sometimes I'll get the roasted pork. Bbq pork has a sweet savory taste to it, while the roasted pork has a crunchy skin with a soft meat to go with it. If you're sensitive to the sauces and tastes of authentic Chinese cuisine, I suggest ordering the roasted pork instead (and try a friend's bbq pork first before committing to it).

Price: Also 5/5. Cheap - what more do you want?

Service: My experinces, despite my lack of Chinese, has been very friendly with the workers. Yeah, the interior sucks but you're literally just there to order and get out so I don't see much of an issue. Though, it is quite unclean considering they serve food.

Portion: Now this is where my 4 star rating comes from. I agree with the other reviewers that they're cheap and the portions are quite filling. However, their MEAT portions are ridiculously inconsitent. Rice is just a filler to make you feel like there's a lot but you're not going there to pay for rice. As indicated by my picture, that day was a great day. Super filled with meat. On bad days it was maybe half of that or even less because they spread it around to make it look bigger. 

In conclusion: Great authentic Chinese bbq for the price and portion OF RICE, but expect inconsistencies with the meat portion. Don't expect to come here to dine and have a nice flashy interior. Go somewhere else to eat. CASH ONLY.",2
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,1,2020-02-10,"This restaurant was formerly known as ""Sichuan Garden Restaurant"" and re-opened last year as ""Ten Miles B.B.Q"".  After reading positive reviews about their Dan Dan Noodles and Sichuan cuisine I popped in alone for a quick lunch.  I was greeted with a very confusing menu.   I wanted to order a few sides, but was advised by the server that my selections were too small. She did not suggest any alternatives.  All of the multiple small plates seem to have only one ingredient and no options for combination dishes like a mixed vegetable platter. I am happy to pay more for more content, but $12 for just bok choy? $6 for one small skewer of basic mushrooms? had to call her over twice until she finally helped me narrow it down to Dan Dan Noodles and a mushroom pot. I was hungry and desperate to order anything at this point.  THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE THE FOOD ARRIVED.  The Dan Dan Noodles were tasty, but after that the server and kitchen staff seemed to prioritize take out orders over mine.  At about 45 mins + from when I walked I had to flag two servers to ask about the mushroom pot I had ordered.  The kitchen staff had only just started the dish! At that point I paid for what I had eaten and walked out.    If you want UNHELPFUL ,SLOW & UNATTENTIVE servers and kitchen staff that (prioritize Uber Eats orders over sit down guests) and don't own up to their mess ups than you might enjoy this restaurant.  I myself will NEVER RETURN.  There are thousands of restaurants in the GTA. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this one! P.S. The management was non-existent. P.P.S. THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE I HAD EVEN RECEIVED THE FOOD!",0
Homemade Ramen,3,2019-03-15,"I guess I'm becoming more health-conscious, but after loading up on carbohydrates in the form of noodles, I didn't feel great afterwards. The noodles themselves are a step above your ordinary noodles, I have to admit. They do a good job in the noddles department, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I ate something that wasn't beneficial for my health or my body. That place was packed on a Friday evening, so I'm guessing it's pretty popular and has a loyal clientele. Despite good service, I probably won't be coming back as my diet and food preferences are slowly shifting toward healthy & nutritious food that good for my body. Everyone has to make their own choice. After all, you are what you eat. Food is medicine if you eat the right food.",1
Hotopia Downtown,1,2019-08-23,Horrible service. I used Yelp waitlist feature and arrived on time. We stood by the door for 20 minutes and nobody bothered to check on us. All the servers were chatting amongst themselves. No single exchange of words at all with their customers.,0
98 Aroma,4,2016-10-06,"In Chinatown, there is a plethora of Asian dining options to choose from. Recently, I had the opportunity to check out the newly opened 98 Aroma where they offer refined Northern Chinese cuisine. The prices are higher than some of the neighboring establishments, so I highly recommend going with a group of 3-5 people to offset the costs. This way, you can order several dishes to share, as most plates are served with generous portion sizes and are meant for sharing. 

The outside may look unassuming, but the interior was designed to replicate traditional Chinese decor with its elaborate wood ornaments, and Asian-inspired craft works. The dimly lit restaurant sets a very relaxing ambiance, and there are several private booths available along with tables.  

The menu consisted of several popular Northern Chinese dishes like dumplings, scallion pancakes, and spicy seafood and beef dishes. Most of Northern Chinese dishes are characterized by its bold flavors, and dishes are served in big portions. So, you can expect both at 98 Aroma. My friend and I started off with the refreshing Summer Breeze Salad ($9.99) - a colorful mixture of sweet-potato noodles, julienne leeks, bell-peppers, red cabbage, radishes, onions, and carrots with a sweet vinaigrette. 

Northern Chinese cuisine is very wheat-based, so I had to order the Pan Fried Pork and Chives Dumplings ($9.99), which was very good. The crispy potstickers were filled with a generous amount of pork, and the chives gave it a nice aroma after being pan fried. 

Next up was their signature dish, the Steamed Tilapia with Chopped Bell Chilies ($29.99) - the dish arrived in a considerable sized bowl with the bone-in tilapia slathered in a rich yet spicy sauce. The fish was juicy and flaky, and the chili-based sauce complemented it beautifully. However, there were just way too many bones, so be extra careful when eating. 

I enjoyed the crispy texture of the Fried Salt and Pepper Calamari ($15.99), and it was perfectly spiced. 

Out of all the dishes, my least favorite was the Signature Chicken Wings ($15.99). Pricewise, it's pretty expensive for wings, and it was lacking in flavor. The peppers were sporadically spread out to the side, so it wasn't spiced very well.

Overall, I had an enjoyable dining experience at 98 Aroma. The restaurant was bustling with customers that Friday evening, and I thought that the wait staff did a good job of handling the customer service. Since they are a new establishment, there were two new waiters on staff training around that time. They were relatively slow, but it's understandable since they're new. 98 Aroma is a welcome addition to the area as they offer a more refined take on Chinese food, and is sure to please the people in the area looking for a nice place to dine.",2
Mexico Lindo,3,2016-10-29,"I would rate this place a 3.5.  The decor was greatly outdated.  The food was tasty Mexican food, nothing wrong with anything my table got.  Just be weary, if you're not into spice make sure you know what you're ordering with the waiter.  The pictures everyone has posted is exactly what we got.

In terms of the service, it was a one man show.  I get what other reviews mean about the service.  This older gentleman (maybe owner?) took the orders, showed people to their seats, bused the tables, refilled water, etc.  He did everything 2-3 waiters would do.  No surprise that getting his attention would be difficult.  We had no issues with the service.  

FYI, if your mouth is on fire from the chorizo or other spicy sauces, Hollywood Gelato is only a few buildings north.",1
Levetto,5,2020-01-27,"Wow! Amazing food! Great big, filling portions, made fresh, and piping hot. Definitely check this place out. The reviews don't lie or exaggerate! Will certainly be back! That's a pic of the beef ragu with perfectly cooked and freshly made rigatoni.",2
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,5,2020-04-22,"I never fully understood the taco genre but my life changed when I had the Baja fish taco. Best taco I've ever had in my life. I think of it often. 

I also had the Pulpo a la Mexicana (octopus), which was also good but I definitely don't love eating octopus in a taco. Biting into a taco with crispy fish is just more satisfying than something chewy, y'know?

A warning to those who are visiting for the first time, there is almost no sitting room in this place so be prepared to bring your tacos elsewhere to eat.

Love this place.",2
Como En Casa,2,2019-08-27,"I took the advice of one of the reviewers on Yelp & I got the hybrid burrito.  Boy was I disappointed.  I thought the flavours were sooo bland & the burrito itself was rice heavy & lacked sufficient amount of meat. Seriously I didn't even want to finish it.

Also it seemed like (from the pics on here) that this was a take out place, but it's not.  It's all table service.  

I just think this restaurant did not hold a candle to restaurants in the same price range.  In other words, it was ridiculously over-priced for what you get.  The burrito alone was around $15.",0
La Vecchia Ristorante,3,2019-07-18,"Going to start off this review by saying the food was great. Our table ordered the Caesar salad, gnocchi ragu, lobster pasta, and tagliolini con funghi. Wonderful food. 

Why the 3 stars? Boy, did we have the most annoyingly cocky/rude/ignorant waiter?! This customer service experience was so frustrating that it warranted a Yelp review. 
Upon entering the restaurant, everyone from the host to the bartenders had been amazing. We came on a busy night and we had no reservations, and the host had us seated at the bar while he scrambled to get us a table for 6. The bartender was great company, and we enjoyed our cocktails while waiting for a table. 
Of course once we were seated, we got stuck with this sarcastic douche bag of an employee... suddenly regretted choosing this restaurant just because of this dude. He made a lot of rude comments, maybe he thought he was funny? Somehow the conversation with him had eventually evolved into him reminiscing about getting 'so f**ked up one time' while our family was trying to enjoy our dinner. That was just the icing on the cake. 

The food did actually take a bit long to come out. We had waited a good half hour after ordering. 

If you can tolerate the company of some really rude and (not funny) sarcastic waiters, then I do recommend trying the food here. Otherwise, there are better places to spend $30-50 per person on dinner that will guarantee better service. Hopefully if you do go, you get a better server.",1
Giulietta,5,2019-04-18,"Oh my god. This place was amazing in every aspect. I came here on a Wednesday night with my coworker and we were aware of the positive reviews but this totally exceeded my expectations. It was pretty busy and we didn't have a reservation so we were seated at the bar. I didn't mind, and the service at the bar was actually phenomenal. Very attentive and friendly. They took time to wipe our table between courses and ensured our drinks were never empty.

We shared the polpo e fagiolli (grilled octopus, cannellini beans and salsa verde) and cavolgiore in paedella (cauliflower, sultana raisins, garlic, lemon and parsley) to start. The latter dish is actually a side but we had it as an appetizer. The octopus, which came highly recommended by the staff was cooked to perfection. It has a nice amount of char to it and was very crispy. The cauliflower was good too - an interesting combination with the raisins but it worked!

For the main, I got the reginelle pappardelle (slow cooked oxtail ragu, pangratto, parsley and parmigiano reggiano). It was soo tasty. There was a good amount of oxtail, and the flavours were all there. There was a crispy layer of breadcrumbs and cheese and it added a bit of texture to every bite. Loved this dish so much.

For dessert we shared the lemon crostata (lemon meringue with candied rosemary) and bonet piemontese (italian custard with amaretto, coffee and vanilla). Nothing but good things to say about both of these dishes!",2

Banh Mi Boys,1,2020-03-10,"I really want to like this place. I really do. I've gone here since 2013, and then I tell myself never again, but it's so close and convenient, etc. But yeah, everytime I go I wonder why it's rated so high by everyone else.

First, banh mi shouldn't take forever to make. Go to any Vietnamese place and the person behind the counter will literally slap together a sandwich in a matter of minutes. They have a team of people working here and it still takes longer somehow.

Second, the banh mi itself (i.e., the bread) doesn't taste right. It's not crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. As for the rest of the sandwich, there's something about it that lacks authenticity. Atop of this, it's way pricier than it should be.",0
Tacos El Asador,3,2020-02-22,"So I'm from San Diego. It is VERY hard for me to find anything even close in taste and quality.

This place has high ratings on here, so we decide to take a shot.

I regret that decision. I ordered three tacos (beef, pastor, carnitas.) The beef tasted like beef jerky, the pastor was super dry and bland, the carnitas tasted like cat food. 

Also you can't just order a small side of chips. It's $10 nachos or $11 guacamole (does it come with chips? Who knows?!)

Super disappointed. Literally had to get boba tea immediately after to cleanse the pallet.",1
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe,4,2018-08-13,"I was so worried this restaurant would be packed when I walked in on Saturday afternoon with a party of 8.  Thank god it was only half full.

The restaurant is on a 2nd level and somewhat small but not too crowded.  
The menu is extensive and you can get pretty much everything that's available in Markham.

I got:
1. Grilled chicken with spaghetti in black peppercorn sauce
- This was delicious.  The pasta was soft without being soggy and I think they melted a little of butter into it - yum.  
- The chicken was a good size and cooked perfectly.  
- The sauce complemented the whole dish, I would definitely reorder.
2. The beef skewers were great. But for $8 it was hefty for 4 skewers. We also found a small fly in our fruit salad. The waiter took off my lemonade ice tea to placate us and gave us another small bowl of fruit salad.  
3. Chicken fried rice. I shuddered a little when my boyfriend ordered this but it turned out very well overall.  The rice wasn't soaked in soy sauce and tasted like your usual chow fan with nice big chunks of chicken and eggs.

Overall this is a pretty good place to hit up if you're craving HK style food.

Service is Chinese (ie. not friendly but very efficient).
Tip: Waiter here speaks both Cantonese and English fluently (huge plus for anybody that's afraid of a language barrier).",2
Ho Ho Barbeque,2,2020-04-10,"Ordered a whole roast duck. One of the worker says to me that he had to cut the duck inside the kitchen. While I came home and opened the take out boxes, one of the box was full but the other box was half full and there were a lot of ducks's necks to replace the empty space. I have assumed they stole some of the goods part of the duck for their combo rice meal and they make $$$ out of that. No wonder that they had to cut the duck inside the kitchen so that you can not see what they are stealing. I had call my friends and they say the same thing.  The duck was good and you can taste the freshness and was not frozen but you lost me as a customer for life. The reasons why I brought the roast duck from them at that time because the other two Chinese roast meat place in the same area was closed due to Covid 19 and they was the only place open for Chinese roast meat. Words of month travel very fast and your business will suffer because of this unethical practice.
Now I know how they are able to sell the rice combo meals so cheap.

Grazie Ristorante,2,2019-10-24,"My review is for Uber eats delivery from Grazie.

GB Hand-pulled Noodles,4,2020-01-18,"Special Lanzhou Noodles with Beef // GB Hand Pulled Noodles.
--
This place is really small, so there was a decent line  around noon. It's best not to come here with more than 3 people. At the front of the store, you can see the noodles being made as orders come in (I.e. you can see someone physically making the noodles). Pictured here are my friends extra wide noodles. I got the thick noodles (circular with a big diameter). I would recommend the extra wide noodles tbh, because the extra thick ones had a doughy taste when I chewed it since the soup wasn't able to penetrate into the noodle. The extra wide noodles have more surface area exposed to the broth, so each bite would be more flavourful! Also, they have extra chili oil on the side if you want to make it spicier! I actually found it to be at a good level of spice. Overall a decent portion, and they didn't cheap out on the beef.",2
Nodo Restaurant,5,2020-05-31,"Pre-Covid review - 

My partner and I have been wanting to come here since we moved into the neighbourhood a year ago.  We have heard great things from several people and finally decided to come for our anniversary dinner.  

The decor is quaint, yet modern.  We were seated at our table, and our waitress came over to tell us the specials.  We wanted to try everything on the menu but settled on splitting the Arancini, the Caesar salad, one of the pastas (I can't recall now) and the tiramisu.  We devoured every bite.  We were the perfect amount of stuffed at the end of it.  The service was fabulous, and we did not feel rushed at all.  

I really like their menu.  They have a lot of traditional Italian dishes, but add their unique flavour.  I also liked the variety of pastas that they have.",2
Fusaro’s Kitchen,4,2019-12-03,"Encountered this cozy and casual Italian spot when hanging out with friends and we all wanted Italian. The food was delicious and the staff were friendly and tentative. It does however, get busier later on during the evening so getting a hold of a staff member will take longer than usual. However, overall a great experience, I would rate this a 4.5/5.",2
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,1,2019-03-03,"Went today with my boyfriend to try the dim sum over the weekend and was disappointed. Got there at 1:30 PM and ordered about four or five different dim sum's and was told to wait while it was being made. 

The order was for take out. Waited for an hour and a bit and still no end in sight of when I would get my order. I must've seen five Uber eats pick up their orders way after me and there were two or three people behind the line that got seated for dine in, and got served their food before me getting my order. 

After waiting patiently for an hour for my take out order to be completed I went up to the cashier and told them to cancel our order since it wasn't even made at that point. All they said was that they were really backed up. I spoke to both workers and said this isn't right that you guys didn't tell us we have to wait A whole hour for take out. We have been standing at the restaurant at the lineup for a whole hour and still our order was not made at that point in time. Poor Organization.",0
Campechano Taquería,3,2019-11-25,"After many friends had recommended this place, I decided to try it. Honestly, it was pretty overrated. The tortillas weren't great, and the guac was just alright. Glad I tried it because the place is cool, but the food is pretty forgettable.",1
Itacate,5,2018-08-24,"After the first bite of the carnitas taco I ordered, I wanted to put it down and apologize to the chef for all the times I made carnitas at home. What the hell was I thinking? How could I dare to think I had the right to make carnitas when this miracle existed?

I've been back a few more times and ordered more items on the menu. Everything I've had is great. Everything is made fresh right in front of you and the ingredients are all at peak yumminess, down to the chopped white onions at the toppings station. 

Hot tip: come here after 10:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays for their special late night menu. They serve up a few different varieties of tortas (basically subs) that feature a generous helping of meat, cheese (if you're into that sort of thing), and guacamole at no extra charge (I'm looking at you, Chipotle). They have a hot dog and egg torta that has absolutely no business being as good as it is. I watched the chef whisk the eggs, chop up the hot dog and cook it all up on the flat top. The eggs were fluffy as hell and the flavours mixed together into a masterpiece that Imran N. and I couldn't believe. 

So yeah. Go here, be polite and get the best damn Mexican food in the city.",2

We were asking about the menu and were met with cold and short replies as if we are suppose to know everything about this restaurant ... while it was the first time that we are coming to this restaurant. 

The portions are over fried / too small/ and not tasty at all. Pizza is a joke ... it's not event a pizza it is a dough with ...no .. not cheese ... with something g like cheese...
Anyways - waste of time / money / and mood.",0
Donatello Restaurant,3,2017-09-24,"A girlfriend took me here for my birthday celebration. Loved the ambience here, and we were lucky enough to be seated on the upper deck patio. Beautiful space - the deck was covered by a huge tree decorated by fairy lights. This made it feel like we were in a completely differently place altogether, away from the hustle and bustle of Downtown Toronto. 

The room next to the upper deck had a family celebrating a birthday; and there was a lady playing the accordion for them. Almost felt like we were in Italy!

I'm giving this restaurant a 3 stars rating solely because of the food. I had the Zuppa Di Pesce, which I asked the sauce to be replaced with the rosé sauce.  I wasn't very impressed with the pasta considering the price. Both in taste and in the seafood quality. 

Service at this restaurant was great - we casually brought up that it was my birthday and they brought a complimentary tiramisu as a surprise! So wonderful! 

I would certainly come back here for drinks/appetizer considering how amazing the space is!",1
Terroni,3,2020-02-20,"The only reason I visited was because I had a gift card due to poor service from my previous visit. I'd say they redeemed themselves in terms of service for this visit. Our server was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive. We were also seated in an area downstairs from the main dining area which made it feel more intimate and allowed the sever to check up on us more often. I came for Valentine's Day dinner and was still able to get a table for a group of 6 a week in advance. 

I ordered the gnocchi and it was alright. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly but the sauce was kind of basic. I've had better gnocchi elsewhere but for the price point here, I was expecting a bit more. I think some pasta may be more worth it than others on their menu. The homemade gelato was the highlight of my meal - super creamy and soft, great flavour, good portion. I had the hazelnut and pistachio and it was some of the best gelato I've ever had. 

Overall, I think you could find better or just as good food elsewhere, at the same price point. But worth a try if your an Italian food lover, even if just for the gelato.",1

I went today and had the salmon pasta (forgot the name), and as usual simply amazing! The service is also outstanding. I've had Jordan twice, he's very friendly and efficient and definitely makes the experience! I don't usually leave my area for food, but Grazie is always worth the subway trip!",2

Hacienda las Américas,2,2019-09-01,"Hacienda las Americas definitely doesn't live up to the scarce 4.5 star rating it possess on Yelp. The only redeeming factor at Hacienda las Americas were its sauces, which were hot, flavourful and added a nice kick to the entrees. But unfortunately the sauces are meant to compliment the entrees, not substitute them, and the entrees leave a lot to be desired.

I went here with my parents and I got the Carne Asada ($18) and them, the Alambre ($18). The Carne Asada is a steak + rice, beans and salad. The steak was extremely thin, tenderized to a point far from its original state, and couldn't have been more than 6oz. It was not a real steak by any meaning of its traditional definition. Worst of all, the steak was barely warm when it came to the table and it had a slightly foul taste to it and was definitely kept in the fridge a day or two too long. There was nothing in the dish that justified its $18 price point - whether that be the ingredients used, the skill put into making the dish or the quantity of the items. 

My parents got the Alambre (fajitas, rice and beans), which was really no better. Fajitas usually come in fresh out of the grill (sometimes a pan), sizzling, smokey and hot. There was none of that. The fajitas were warm, like the steak I ordered, and seemed more like a product of the microwave than a grill.",0
Chula Taberna Mexicana,2,2019-07-27,"When did Gerrard and Jones become a popular destination? Good on it. 

Quick summary:

- nice rooftop patio
- I had slowish service
- Food was good. We had a churizo bowl and the ceviche. Both were solid. I didn't notice anything special about the menu. Standard upper-middle level Mexican foods. 
- Drinks ok (cider + tequila based fruity blend).
- overpriced. Why is Mexican food so expensive in Toronto? It's mostly bloody rice, tomatoes, lettuce, avo, standard meats.
- The staff was decent not great but it was busy hence the pressure of Friday night at play. 
- Personally I wouldn't go back at that pricing but if you don't mind that you may like the food. 

2/5 maybe 2.5.

Ha Gow Dim Sum House,3,2017-09-30,"Dim sum wasn't bad. I actually preferred this over the downtown China Town dim sum, but markham was better. But if don't feel like a drive thru traffic, not a bad second choice.

Ignore the decor or I think if they rearranged some stuff it would look good.

Will go back...",1
La Marquesita,3,2019-04-08,"4 stars for their crispy beef tacos, 2 stars for their very greasy veggie tacos. I prefer their crispy tacos to those at the Haam.

Honestly, their crispy tacos are pretty solid, but they need serve it yourself salsa to really bring them together and put them over the top. I'll probably bump this to 4 stars once they do let customers add their own salsa.

Otherwise, you'll still likely get better tacos than you're expecting from this tiny shack across from the Eaton Centre.",1
Terroni,3,2020-01-25,"I would describe this place as a trendy Italian restaurant. My review will only comment on the pizza as I haven't tried the pastas (it seems like my friends enjoyed them). 
I wasn't too impressed by the pizza, the crust was thin and quite crispy, toppings tasted fresh and good quality but not very generous. It's a good place to go for simple business meetings as the atmosphere is nice and trendy or maybe for a date but if you're looking for a more local small  business type of vibe, I would pass. 
Service was a good and fairly fast. I would mind coming back but not my first choice.",1
Playa Cabana,3,2018-09-07,"My friend and I decided on Mexican food for dinner and this popped up as nearby where we were at the time, Yorkville/Annex area. As we walked in, immediately we're greeted and seated in a tight space for 2. The menu was explained to us and water was given, then we were left for a few minutes to decide. 

We decided on salsa fresca & chips, chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas along with a bottle each of corona and negra cervezas.

Salsa fresca and chips arrived first, the tomato salsa was delicious, the morita chile seemed to have been grilled before it was mashed together with tomatoes and red onions and went well with the crispy chips. (If you come for anything at all, this would be it and definitely skip the guac as it didn't seem appetizing.)

My friend and I shared the chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas, while tasty, I could've gotten it somewhere else for cheaper. 

Because of how tight the space is, I was able to look around at what the other dinners ordered and the the tacos seemed to be more popular, so will have to come back and try those.

We also ordered alfajores, which at $8 for 2 was just meh.",1
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,3,2019-02-14,"This place is conveniently located a couple blocks from Dundas TTC station. It is also a block from Eaton Centre. The place is a bit crammed and a bit small, so be sure to give some waiting time if you are going at noon.

We ordered the special Lanzhou beef noodles. There are a variety of noodle options in varying thickness. The portions are sufficient for some people, but as I am a big eater, I wasn't full from the large. The noodles are good. The soup is a bit bland. And the beef isn't quite flavourful. There is not much memorable about this place, except that the prices are quite unreasonable with respect to the quality.

Overall, I would not recommend this place, but I haven't yet come across a good place for hand-pulled noodles to recommend.",1

Khao San Road,3,2020-01-13,"Well my wife and I finally got around to try the new location of Khao San Road on Charlotte St. I love the decor and design of this location very interesting use of space, at first I thought there was only maybe room for about 20 people but as our server took us around the corner there was more seating for about another 20 to 30 people. The ambiance is really loud here and the back tables are mainly long high tops so plan to share with other people. 

The service is ok nothing too over the top but I give them a benefit of a doubt cause it was lunch time and it was full house and the servers were all running around. It didn't take long to flag our server down for some additional napkins, however our water glasses were empty and no one came around to refill until we asked. 

The food was ok as well we had ordered the Garlic Tofu and Garlic Chicken to start. Both appetizers were very crunchy and crispy the garlic taste was a bit muted in my opinion both also come with a ramekin of the typical Thai sweet chili dipping sauce. Very crunchy exterior which locked in all the juice inside.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prao with beef add $1 and fried egg add $1 which is basically a dry curry with beef, red peppers, onions, red and green chili peppers and also a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of white jasmine rice. I found that the beef was slightly too salty and too dry. Overall 3.5 / 5 for me. 

We also ordered the Khao Soi which is a soup noodle with egg noodles in a curry based soup. We opted to get the beef option for an additional $1. The presentation was really nice flavours were good slightly on the sweet side for my liking but when lime juice is added the flavour sort of balanced itself out. I think this is a 4 / 5 for me.

Overall just another Thai restaurant in the city that serves authentic Thai food. But didn't really blow me away.

Banh Mi Boys,4,2019-10-03,"Solid. I always get the grilled pork banh mi, and am always happy with my choice.

There are 3 levels of heat to choose from - sriracha, jalapeño, habañero. Having gone the jalapeño route a few times and finding there wasn't enough heat, I got the habañero and found there was way too much. You never know what a batch of peppers is going to be like on a given day, which keeps things exciting. Now I go for ""extra"" jalapeño... which is often just the perfect amount of too much.

If it's sunny out, my banh mi boy and me like to order in, but take our order out to a nearby park to eat. The meat is warm, the sandwich well constructed and well wrapped (a cute little elastic band holds it all together)... and the fresh, grilled bun makes it all come together. Orders come up pretty fast here, and the price cannot be beat. I wish there was a location in Queen West.",2
Hotopia Downtown,3,2019-12-12,"I've been here once before and had a good experience. The pickled cabbage beef soup was plentiful for two people and we had enough to EACH take home for a second meal. Everything was delicious and I craved it everyday until I went again. 

The second time, there was barely anything in the soup and they forgot the pickled cabbage...the pickled cabbage that's in the name! I brought it to a waiter's attention and she had the audacity to just bring it out in a bowl, did not offer for the kitchen to add it to the soup and recook it. Very disappointed.

Chop Chop,4,2019-01-07,"I enjoyed a solo dinner here recently. The room is is tiny, but I grabbed a window seat. I had three dishes. The pan-fried dumplings were very good; fresh and expertly fried and lots of flavour, albeit very similar to what you can find elsewhere in Chinatown (see Mother's Dumplings and the Dumpling House for example). The green beans were truly outstanding; perfectly cooked and seasoned, and not too greasy. I could eat a plate of those beans for lunch every single day.

The only (small) misstep was the Taiwanese basil chicken. While hot and fresh, it was a little dry and didn't have much basil flavour.

I would definitely return.",2
Swatow Restaurant,3,2019-08-22,"The food here is amazing. I understand why previous reviews mentioned it being an OG spot and authentic taste overall. They specialized in more FuZhou cooking but it's good cause it doesn't have the oily and greasy taste afterwards. We enjoyed everything we ordered and the portions were a great size for what we needed that day. They cook really good snow pea leaves, probably one of the best I've had in Chinese restaurants. So definitely no complaints about the food at all, it's totally worth it but CASH ONLY! 

The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 is because they don't have the best table service (which seemed to be the case in the Toronto Chinatown area). The waiting staff look really annoyed at you and the lack of hospitality is not what I'm used to when I go to restaurants. Maybe the workers are being overworked and not compensated enough, just don't let it rub you the wrong way if you want to try the food, it does come out fast and I did really enjoy it.",1

Mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta was Michu better in comparison. Mushroom bruschetta was nice and crunchy. The mushrooms were flavoured nicely and brought out a lot of its natural flavours. The panna cotta has a citrusy taste and a really great summer treat!

Taverna Mercatto,2,2019-12-19,"This is definitely Italian food for the after-work crowd, a Buca di Beppo-type of experience that didn't leave that much of an impression on my palate. It wasn't that the food was badly executed but rather that the plates were by-the-numbers unmemorable. I was here with the same dozen people I had been with for the previous eight hours, so small talk opportunities had already been exhausted as we sat closely together at a communal table. Because of the size of our party, I was able to try quite a number of their dishes and got a reasonably broad cross-section.

The common adjective connecting the plates was 'bland'. We started with the $14 Calamari Fritti which apparently came with shishito peppers that had disappeared by the time the plate was passed to me (photo: http://bit.ly/35MxgSg). Meh. I did manage to snag one of the overly chilled prawns on the $21 Shrimp Cocktail platter (photo: http://bit.ly/2EE5UBy). Better were the $13 Beets & Burrata with arugula and toasted almonds (photo: http://bit.ly/34Lnhva) and the $12 Greens which added celery hearts for crunch and a drizzle of sherry vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/36TVmKG). The pasta plates were pretty standard issue given the couple of bites I was able to get of each.

The $21 Linguine di Mare was a typical seafood melange with little imagination (photo: http://bit.ly/2PGtJ22), while the $18 Tortiglioni alla Bolognese at least provided meatiness in the veal & pork ragu, but again it was bland and lacked freshness (photo: http://bit.ly/373WnjJ). The three different pizzas disappointed. The $18 Verdure had toppings and a basil pesto that were rather skimpy on the chewy crust (photo: http://bit.ly/38R3Y6R). while the $17 Margherita was just wet (photo: http://bit.ly/2Q1UXzi). Only the $19 Prosciutto was reasonably good with the padano cheese and prosciutto more plentiful (photo: http://bit.ly/34GULe2). 

Dessert came on cutting boards, and they offered a trio of which truthfully I only tried the Tiramisu Cake Roll which was OK (photo: http://bit.ly/2M8ukaH). There was also Chocolate Budino and Cannolo though my colleagues grabbed those pretty quickly (photo: http://bit.ly/36UM69j). My favorite part of the meal? The $14 Pimms Cup with ginger ale, lemon & cucumber, which honestly hit the spot far more than any of the food (photo: http://bit.ly/2SarzJH). Listen, none of us had high hopes for culinary delights here, and even our sponsor admitted this was not her first choice, but the proximity to our hotel just made it so convenient.

FOOD - 2.5 stars...standard issue Italian with few surprises
AMBIANCE - 2 stars...loud and rather packed after work

RELATED - Traveling to Toronto? Here's a collection of places I've tried and reviewed: http://bit.ly/2LETSfV",0
Enoteca Sociale,5,2019-04-06,Great place with such a cozy ambiance! We sat at the bar and enjoyed some of the best ribeye steak I ever had! My husband got the Caccio e Peppe! The ribeye was seasoned perfectly and the salad that came with us was perfect! I wish I was staying in Toronto long enough to eat here again!,2
98 Aroma,1,2019-06-09,"Oh my God!! How did they get high ratings!!????? They had sectional sittings and some open areas. The place is dark for a Chinese restaurant. The decor is mostly wooden plaques and wood carvings. 

The servers or staff there were not friendly and talked behind your back. Yes, I understand Mandarin even though I spoke English to them!! I had to get up twice to get their attention and they only had three tables with customers. 

It's supposed to be fine dining so I had a feeling that the portion would be smaller. Ok. But why all the saltiness in your dishes!!! The veggie dish was pricey and decent. The shrimp fried rice lacked the shrimps. They were tiny!! The rice was hard. It felt more of a Caucasian dish. The beef and broccoli dish was the largest dish full of salt!! Basically eat and drink lots of water. 

I was obviously not satisfied or full. Dishes were TOO SALTY, even my friend didn't like them. 

Never will I go back!",0
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,1,2016-05-21,"Inauthentic and bland. Red flags: No classic numbing spice flavor. Missed the spot on 2 signature dishes so I won't be coming back. 

The cold noodles appetizer was had noodles that were thick and tasted like spaghetti and old lard. No complimentary contents either--you can usually expect some sesame oil or thinly chopped black fungus or something but this was a low effort fail completely. 

The ""mouth watering chicken"" which is a cold chicken dish was sitting in a pool of chili oil and soy sauce (which is normal) but completely lacked flavor and spice--it should carry the sweet flavor of cooking wine, the saltiness of soy sauce and have the savory ""ma la"" numbing spice that makes your lips and tongue tingle. The only thing resembling the classic dish was the fact that the chicken was rather bony and gristly. I had to ask for more hua jiao (si chuan pepper) oil to make it edible 

I'm horribly disappointed and the two dishes cost me $14. It's overpriced at this rate. The decor is austere but rundown (fake wooden footbridge leading into banquet style restaurant that looks tatty) and I guess the fact it was empty on a Friday evening at 9 was highly suspect. Please just go to Si Chuan house cuisine if you're looking for anything nearly close to spicy",0
Donatello Restaurant,4,2019-12-22,"Tiny spot in the over saturated commercial mess that is Yonge-Dundas, Donatello is a welcome institution. I can't emphasize how small this place is but well worth the cramped space for the gnocchi. Absolutely delicious. 
I've been twice; service was great even with a Saturday evening walk-in (my sister and I got the last table - score!)",2
Stelvio,3,2018-03-23,"Hovering between 3 and 4 stars. The food was delicious to be sure, but the price point was extremely high for the portions we received. I realized the pasta is made in house so that accounts for a lot of it, but it still just felt pretty pricey given we didn't really order that much and got pretty hungry again a few hours later.

My husband ordered the ravioli (8 small ravioli in dish. It was FANTASTIC but a tiny portion) and I had the mushroom tagliatelle (also great but just mushrooms tossed in a light sauce with a bit of parsley). We also split the chocolate cake for dessert and I had a glass of wine and the whole tab came out to around $70. WHAT. The night before we ate at another restaurant with dishes packed with seafood, veggies, meat, and more and we spent the same amount of money for around 8-9 small plates of food. And everything was made from scratch there as well. 

The experience was nice, and the food was good but I would probably not return given you can get more for your money in Toronto at other locations and have an equally delicious meal.",1
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,2,2019-12-29,"Came here on a Sunday evening with 4 people. The seafood risotto was good with lots of seafood. 

The surprising part was that the server/restaurant added automatically added a 20% tip to the bill. He just put in the tip amount himself on the POS terminal and said service charge was added. 

I do not like being forced into tipping at a certain amount and therefore would not visit the restaurant again.",0
Donatello Restaurant,5,2019-08-15,"Gorgeous patio, friendly service, and amazing food. This place feels like you are dining at an Italian house. They have an extensive menu, and the portion sizes are pretty big. We tried Caesar salad, gnocchi and the salmon dish plus a dessert which was really good but I don't remember the name of. Everything was delicious. They are really generous with their parmesan, which they only add to each dish after serving it to you. Service was great; we ended up chatting with our server in the end for a while who turned out to be such a lovely person! They put a lot of effort into making their patio look good. I recommend reserving a table on the upstairs patio. The tree right in front of the restaurant is decorated with lights and it makes the whole place so beautiful and romantic with all the lighting and colourful flowers. 

I liked everything about this restaurant. Will be back for sure to try their other dishes.",2
Good Hombres,4,2020-01-17,"After hearing many phenomenal reviews about Good Hombres, and having tried its sister restaurant Campechano, I felt very much obligated and drawn to trying this place! To my knowledge, they've recently begun taking reservations, so I placed one for a Thursday night. It's quite a long, narrow joint - upon walking in, you're met with a kitchen counter / bar for takeout and quick orders. To get to the main dining room, you pass through a small doorway. The vibe is also significantly different from Campechano; it's a far more casual vibe adorned with bright, colourful paintings.

To be honest, I was on the fence between 3 and 4 stars. On the one hand, I really did enjoy the tacos and they're objectively better than most places. On the other, I enjoyed Campechano much more, but gave that place 4 stars. In terms of cost / value, both place ended up costing me roughly the same, but I found Campechano to be far more satisfying (they have a double tortilla and have heftier, more generous fillings).

We ordered 10 tacos (for $3.95) each. I got the pescado (fish / haddock), champinones (mushrooms), camaron (shrimp) for my first round. For my second, I got a second pescado and added the barbacoa (lamb leg). My boyfriend got the carnitas (confit pork shoulder), pastor (pork butt), and barbacoa. For his second round, he got double carnitas - he just loved it that much!

Carnitas & Barbacoa
These tacos tasted identical to the ones I had at Campechano, so my review remains unchanged. The carnitas, being cooked in its own fat, is a very rich and hearty concoction. There's no real acidity, apart from the lime, to balance out the flavours - as such, it's a very pure, meaty delight. The barbacoa is seasoned and has more spices, and the meat is less 'tender and soft' compared to the pork (though objectively still very tender).

Pastor
The pork butt is definitely tougher and drier than the other meats, but still super flavourful. I particularly liked the addition of the pineapples - while it threw me off initially, I found that the fruitiness helped balance the textures and flavours. 

Pescado
There was a good chunk of fried haddock on the taco, topped with some pickles and spicy chipotle mayo. It was delicious - and so lightly battered! The flavour is a bit more muted than the meat tacos, but so satisfying. 

Champinones
This was the weakest one, I found - but still super fragrant and umami. The mushrooms didn't go as well with the tacos as the other options, but it's still very flavourful and far better than the poblano peppers I had at Campechano last time.

Camaron
I personally found this taco a bit difficult to eat; the small pieces of deep fried, brown shrimp bits often crumbled and threaten to cascade on my plate. That said, the flavours were delicious! I found them somewhat similar to the pescado (likely attributed to the common denominator of chipotle mayo), but the flavours were far richer and heartier. Definitely my favourite - and this is a slightly 'pricier' (though nonetheless not expensive) taco at $4.25. Well worth it!

Overall, I did thoroughly enjoy Good Hombres. The tacos are smaller than those at Campechano (maybe ~60% of the size?) but the flavours are the same. The service and ambiance is good. It's likely a nature of the tacos I chose (fish and shrimp), but I found there to be too much chipotle mayo. That said, I would definitely come again, and cannot wait for the opening of their third store!",2
Artisan Plus,1,2019-10-07,"The food here was mediocre but the service was absolutely abysmal, to the point where I'm not even considering the food in the rating I'm giving. 

The server was extremely rude - I asked for an iced tea (canned drink) upon being seated after a 20 minute wait and the server legit said ""just order your drink when you order everything else"" and walked away, even though it was simply a canned drink that takes 1 minute to take out of the fridge. 

When it came time to order our meal, I asked for the drink again, which the server acknowledged. I didn't receive the drink during my whole meal and no one came to check on us so I wasn't able to reorder. 

When the bill came, they actually had the audacity to charge us for the drink that I never received, and when we asked them to take it off the bill they didn't come back with the bill for over 15 minutes, and didn't print a receipt for us because their ""machine was broken"". 

Honestly I'm not sure if we were charged for it, but a place that would allow their servers to talk to/treat customers like this is definitely not a place that I would recommend to others because it says a lot about the restaurant's values and culture, and the food is definitely not special enough to put up with this kind of service.",0
El Catrin Destileria,3,2019-10-19,"Would give the drinks a 4/5. Extremely slow wait (~14 minutes to get our drinks). Also asked to remove agave from one of our drinks and the waiter did not communicate that properly to his bar tender - so we got stuck with agave in one of our drinks even though we asked to remove it. 

Not worth the wait. Take your business elsewhere. Did not try the food so I can't give any insight to that.",1
Hotopia Downtown,1,2019-09-25,Poor service. Extremely slow. You have to wait for 30 minutes to be sited and another 40 minutes for your food. Will not come back,0
Hacienda las Américas,3,2019-08-24,"Unfortunately, Hacienda las Americas didn't live up to the hype. My wife and I went here for dinner and got:
- Guacamole and chips: Guac was surprisingly bland and chips tasted store-bought.
- Sopes: This looked like a thick tortilla with lots of meat and veggies on it. It was 3 for $12, which we thought was a pretty good deal so got 6. The standout was the chorizo (super tasty and great bite). The chicken, beef suadero, beef sirloin, and beef tongue were pretty standard-to-good. The carnitas was too stringy and a little tough for me.

Maybe I'm in the (Yelp) minority and wasn't blown away with this place because I didn't get the tacos... but they were using the same meats for the tacos as the sopes, so I'm doubtful I'd have a different review. Worth a try once, but won't be back.",1
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,3,2020-04-20,"This place is a small hole in the wall and worth visiting if you crave some good old fashioned tacos rather than the commercial stuff.. portion sizes were good however the flavours were slightly missing for me.. 

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot.. 

This place has great service, friendly staff and a small seating area if you just want to eat quickly or grab'n'go.",1
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2017-12-21,"The food was good and the presentation was awesome but I expected it to be more flavourful. 

The place is clearly family run and the service was great because of that. The lady who served me was super sweet.",1
Enoteca Sociale,5,2019-11-16,"One word. FANTASTIC. Came in with no reservation for 2. Immediately the host/ front of house squad accommodated me and got me seated within 2-mins (I was fully prepared to wait for a table). Me and the birthday boy were both first timers - our server had excellent recommendations and he even brought us complimentary olives (WE LOVED THE OLIVES AND BREAD)!!! Ordered off the 3 for 22, the meat portions were GENEROUS... we just came back from Italy in October and felt like we were in Rome again. Some places in TO don't serve portions like that (don't want to say any names - but you know king W isn't your friend). Anyways, carried on and ordered 2 pasta dishes to share the duck and the amatriciana - both were divine. I think the noodles stole the show, thick, soft, and buttery. We ordered the coffee dessert and our server (tall, beard, soft voice, I think he had red hair?) brought  us a surprised cannoli with a candle - very nice touch to end the evening. Other things I wanted to point out - I LOVED the diverse staff, the interior, the soft candles, the low lights, and the intense/bad ass bread cutting lady! She means business. 

Overall, we will be back. Xx",2
House of Gourmet,3,2019-10-11,"Good for assisting in the time of need.....HANGOVERS.

These guys are open and you can order before 4pm unlike some nasty places who don't care about my suffering.

The food is very reasonably priced and pretty good too, a usual is the beef in black bean sauce which is solid and very filling...on the other hand the fried rice dishes are not the greatest and can lack a lot of flavor.

Good place just be sure what your ordering is something powerful in flavor as the more subtle options generally tend to fail.",1
Donatello Restaurant,4,2018-07-19,"Came here with the hubby and a friend for a casual dining evening and enjoyed our time here. 

It's something between a casual and formal dinner setting and right in the middle of downtown. They have multiple seating options which is amazing. They had an outdoor patio, indoors on the first floor and a balcony available for seating. On a summer evening, sitting outside was just perfect! 

We ordered some prosecco and enjoyed our drinks when we got some bread and oil. The service was decent but we did feel that they were prioritizing some other customers over us. People who came long after we did got served their bread and drinks while we waited for us. 

Our food was tasty - we got the specials (salmon and pasta) and the chicken in a rose sauce from the menu. Both were delicious. 

The rooftop patio/balcony is where we sat and it was beautiful. I highly recommend sitting outdoors if possible during a warm day. 

When we got our bill, the staff member added the gratuity on it automatically but it wasn't clear. When we asked him to explain what was written on it he started saying something very random which didn't make sense. We had someone else come and explain it to us that it was the gratuity. I did feel that the serving staff could do a bit more to make a better experience in terms of service. But overall this place gets a 3.5 to 4 Star for its food and ambience experience.",2
Khao San Road,3,2019-09-24,"Food 4, 4.5 stars
Not a 5 with the price, average sized portion, about 20 a plate, tad pricey.. place is packed, charge what they want!

ONE STAR for interior; ridiculously loud, annoying.  People hot/sweating, packed everyday, maybe a little AC?
Tight, tight corridors; poor staff, everyone in the way.  Minimal room to maneuver.
Never returning, I'd suggest for those interested; TAKE OUT!",1
La Chingada,5,2020-02-12,"Best staff and best tacos!!!!  Mikaela and Myles were just EXCELLENT and ensured that I (a person who tastes soap in cilantro) was well taken care of.  Come here on a Wednesday night, like we did, and you will get the most out of the excellent customer service. 
A+++!",2
Giulietta,4,2018-10-31,"My outlook improved when the burrata ($30) was set on the table. The cheese draped with thin slices of salty prosciutto, why mess with a great combination? 

Since the bread wasn't toasted or oiled, it was a bit chewy and difficult to get a knife through, so if it was cut thinner it would be even better. The caramelized onion and fig spread on the bread was absolutely delicious and went so nicely with the milky flavourful cheese, which was served at a perfect room temperature. The staggering $30 price tag was a bit of a surprise though... note to self, always ask for prices with specials.  

Well marbled beef was used in the carne cruda di chianina ($19) and while I couldn't taste the fried garlic mentioned on the menu, the anchovy was an interesting addition to the mix. We're asked if we'd like a side of bread ($3) which, in my opinion, is a must. You really need something to spread the beef tartare on or it'd be way too salty and overpowering on its own. For those that are abstaining from carbs, perhaps a salad would help balance the flavourful beef.

Even one of Giulietta's pizzas would be a great shared starter. The l'amentea ($21) has a healthy portion of spicy soppressata and tons of garlic that would give Count Dracula a scare. I love garlic so found it went nicely with the soppressata, but did drown out the fior di latte, which became more for its creamy chewy texture than flavour. The well blistered crust was coloured evenly and had a lovely chewy texture, but could be thicker in the middle as the paper-thin centre became lost amongst the sauce.",2
7 Numbers Restaurant,1,2019-10-25,"Extremely disappointing and mundane. 

Served frozen fish, the lasagna pasta was so overcooked it was actually falling apart and floury. There was not one element of any dishes that I actually enjoyed and while sitting here, I can't wait to leave so I can go to shoppers and get a frozen pizza...",0
Artisan Plus,2,2019-12-31,"Tight seating area with not much space between tables, nor to put winter parkas. My friend's seat was more like a plastic stool. Not comfy at all. More of a eat and run place but your tummy might be hungry still. 

The service was good. We got three water refills from the bottle as it was small. 

My dish came out messy and the portion for $14 was small. There aren't enough veggies. The spicy taste was a good quick to it. The noodle looked like gnocchi and it was chewy. My friend's dish came later on as they messed up the order. She said it was ok. Again, one is paying the price for a small portion of food that wouldn't fill up one's stomach 

So definitely I was still hungry before heading to the theatre. 

Verdict- not sure where they are getting the high reviews but it's not worth my time. For $14 plus taxes and tips, I'll rather eat at a food court that would satisfy this Cat-Squirrel's tummy. Bring on the food!!",0
Ristorante Sotto Sotto,5,2019-02-06,"What a fantastic place! A hidden gem at that! We had reservations and once we arrived we were immediately seated upstairs in a dim area lit with candles. Our server was lovely and described the specials and menu in detail. I went with the Pappardelle Dei Castelli and Minestrone soup. We were brought some fresh bread and olive oil which was amazing. 

My soup was amazing. Not over done and was tasty. The entree was perfection. You can tell the noodles are homemade and wow that sauce was amazing- I opted for butter cream sauce versus the wine sauce that is typically included. Glad I went this route!! 

We had to try some dessert too so we all split the Gelato Affogato and Devils Chocolate Gelati. Both were satisfying and presented nicely. 

Love this intimate establishment and will definately be back!",2
Nodo Restaurant,5,2018-10-26,"We came out for dinner and decided Nodo was the best option tonight.  We were not disappointed. 

The food was delicious. 

We decided on the calamari, pizza and pasta special. Wow!  The flavours were spectacular, the service was attentive.  

We had a minor issue with our meal, and the manager was amazing, dealt with our issues right away. 

We will definitely be back.",2
Sugo,2,2020-03-09,This place is overhyped.... the food was quite mediocre however the line was out the door the entire time we were there. We tried the Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. The meatball was delicious. However the rest was forgettable.,0
Chop Chop,3,2018-12-10,"Let me first say that I was walking into this restaurant expecting to give this place a 4-star (if not 5-star review). I was skeptical of the reviews that rated this place under 4-stars because of raving reviews from co-workers of mine. However, that co-worker went to this place the Friday before I came and also deemed the quality has declined. So maybe it is worthwhile reading on my review as to why that's the case.

My friend and I ordered three things so i'll describe each item below- starting with the best.

1. Green beans- if all the other food was as good as this one, I would've given this place a 4-star review. Fresh, flavorful, and on-point. The wringly green beans stir-fried into the peppers and mushrooms were fantastic. However, this was a very small plate for it to cost $11. Quality: 4.5/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5.

2. Fried rice- this was their featured fried rice and a recommendation from the co-worker. I'm not a fried rice person to begin with but chose this because of the rec. This was just fried rice I could get at any chinese restaurant in chinatown for probably 75% of this cost. It was a lot but not memorable. Quality: 3.5/5. Price for the food amount: 4/5 

3. Boiled pork and chive dumplings- having chosen the healthier version of the dumpling options (versus fried), these turned out to be the most disappointing meal here. The dough/skin of the dumpling was very thick (and this is my greatest fear). The ratio of meat to skin was probably 1:2.5. Quality: 2/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5. You can get the same dumplings but WAYYYYYY better at dumpling house in Chinatown. Thank me later and go there.

So in conclusion, if you're looking for the hype of this place that came from BlogTO or other reviewers, this place will not meet your standards. I would go elsewhere for chinese food- specifically Chinatown; unless you want the aesthetics and hip vibe, then this place got that nailed down.",1
Zhang’s Kitchen,3,2020-03-14,"One cold winter afternoon... hungry... cold... wandering mindlessly downtown, I stumbled upon Zhang's Kitchen tucked in the southern side of Elm Street. 

The restaurant itself is not big and I arrived late afternoon. An eerie quietness besets the restaurant. After settling down they started putting on some mandarin pop songs and handed over water and the paper menu.  Service was courteous and efficient. 

Menu wise is extremely limited here, they specialize in yellow braised dishes.  I chose yellow braised chicken with thick noodles; a fine choice for a frigid day. The sauce that was reduced and used to braised the chicken was excellent. The simple flavours created by the cooking wine, ginger, scallion, leek, and other ingredients was delicious and would warm any stomach or heart.  The chicken was equally done well. The chicken was fall off the bones texture (even though their chicken was bone-less) without giving any feeling of it being overcooked. 

What prompted a less than four star when everything sounded great? A few things... first the noodles lacked texture. They were pretty limp and felt like overcooked store bought versions. The mushroom that was added to the dish were the wet variety and the flavour of the mushroom failed to transfer to the sauce. They also added strings of green pepper on top of the dish for aesthetic purposes. This may be a personal thing but I hate when green peppers become fully cooked (while not having been grilled). 

Overall score for Zhang's Kitchen is a solid 3.4. Unless they work on their noodles, you may want to stick with rice.",1
Chula Taberna Mexicana,3,2019-08-02,"I came here with a friend and ordered the beef and the fish tacos. The food was pretty good, but the restaurant was quite busy so the food took a long time to arrive. The restaurant was also nicely decorated and the rooftop area was very nice.

Unfortunately the service was pretty bad, and we waited over 15 minutes just to order. Probably won't be returning because of this.",1
Terroni,3,2019-11-01,"Authentic italian food served in the same fashion.

Service: The staff were friendly, but the wait times were pretty unacceptable considering we had a large group with a reservation. We arrived on time, but still had to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table, and it almost ruined the surprise birthday. The food came as ordered, but the waiters clearly didn't communicate with each other as they didn't know who ordered what and had to check several times.

Food: The pasta was cooked al dente, closer to the firmer side. You could tell the pasta was fresh, and they were fairly generous with the truffle shavings. However, the seasoning was a bit overwhelming, as it seemed to overpower the truffle flavour.

Overall: Seating was nice in a semi-private room, food was bene, but waiting half an hour for a reserved spot is not appreciated.",1
Baretto Caffe,4,2018-09-12,"Completely hidden from the street as it's located inside a medical building.  Thank you for the Yelper who posted the photo of the actual building!  Otherwise, I would've missed it.  :)

Very, very close to a 5*!  The only reasons why it missed the mark was that the food took sometime after ordering, 20mins+.  And there was a missing ingredient in the Fantasia Salad - corn!  I didn't bother mentioning it 'cause we were soo hungry by the time the food arrived.

If you're looking for a quick meal, this is not the place for you.  Please allow some time to soak in the '80s Italo-Disco music and the owners kind demeanor!

Personally, if it were my first time, I'd order a caffeinated drink (good beans), pasta, pizza, panini, & pastry.  I'd skip the salads.  The Fantasia was good, but it's something that you can make at home.  Latté was smooth and very, very good!

Pasta with rosé sauce was DELICIOUS!  It arrived to the table piping hot and fresh tasting.  If you're not too hungry, it can definitely be shared btw 2 ppl as it also comes with some garlic bread + a side salad.

Owner was very nice, always checking in on us.  She was upbeat and always said, ""with pleasure"" and seemed to mean it!  There were some nice touches like providing us with place mats and glasses of water with ice.  Very warm atmosphere!

Too bad/thank God this place isn't located too close by.  Otherwise, it can be dangerous!",2
Dynasty Chinese Cuisine,2,2019-06-24,"We tried this place since it's close to our hotel and shopping places. 
The ambiance was great and place looks clean. But the service needs a lot of work. The hot and sour soup is terribly spicy and no taste. Just the hot spice. So I ordered another soup. The wonton soup. It took them almost 30 minutes to bring my soup out. And likewise no taste and very UN-CHINESE flavor. 
We also asked one waiter about a cocktail mix and he initially gave me the impression that he does not want to be asked about the drinks and the menu. The waiter said I'll get back it's you but he never did come back. Almost All waiters and servers here are very UNFRIENDLY AND NO SMILE at all. Very disappointing place.!!!!",0
Swatow Restaurant,5,2019-10-21,"And still and absolute belter of a Chinese, the best beef in black bean sauce in the city!

I always intend to try something new but always end up with this and shrimp fried rice - great comfort food.",2
Enoteca Sociale,3,2017-10-27,"This was in a quieter area. The restaurant was really empty when I came on a weekday. They have a small patio area that is facing a small street. We were seated immediately but no one gave us the menus until 5 minutes later. The service was really slow despite the fact that it was early in the evening without many customers. I noticed they were training some employees that day, so only a few were serving the entire restaurant.

Appetizers: Me and my friends tried a few appetizers and we loved every single one of them.The arancini was great, it was so cheesy and the tomato sauce packed enough flavor. My favorite appetizer is definitely the chicken liver mousse though. The mousse was very flavorful and so smooth. The jelly with the mousse added a nice touch. Next best appetizer is the beef crudo. The aioli served with the beef crudo was amazing, and the beef crudo tasted so fresh overall. I say the chicken liver mousse and the beef crudo are a MUST GET here! 

Mains: The pasta we ordered was SOO SALTY! My group kept waving our server for more water. I hope all their pasta isn't like this, it could be the particular one we got. But the pasta was disappointing. The noodles were cooked nicely, but the sauce was just too salty. We also ordered a side dish of green beans which were alright.

In conclusion, I love the food here. The prices are decent. But I would probably stay away from the pasta that we got this time. Perhaps I will try another pasta next time. The service was slow and my table didn't get much attention from our server. I would have rated it higher if there was better service.",1
