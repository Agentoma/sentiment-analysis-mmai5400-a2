Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,3,2020-03-16,"I'm really not sure why this place has such great reviews, I found the food merely average. The interior reminds me more of the Southeast Asia budget ""backpacker"" vibe, ie partiers. It's certainly a part of the Thai experience but not really my thing.

Tom yum soup - this was pretty solid with vibrant flavors and a good kick. Maybe I've really lost spice tolerance but I was starting to drip before I was done with the cup...

Pad cha hett - mushroom stir fry. I got this with black rice just to try something new and it didn't quite fit the rest of the dish. If you get this, stick with the jasmine. The stir fry part was disappointingly bland though. It had a bit of a fennel taste to it, not sure what that comes from.",1
El Charro,4,2017-09-19,"Mexican food done right! 

The meat was cooked so well, juicy and flavourful. The caramelized onions added another dimension of great flavour.  We also got guac and chips for $4.50 very good as well. 

To those who complain about waiting for food.. you are only waiting because they are making it fresh. It's not like chipotle where it sits there for what could be hours.

Good prices, good food!",2
Itacate,4,2018-08-28,"I ordered suadero (beef) tacos. I didn't have high expectations because I've eaten real tacos in Mexico City and it's hard to match that authentic taste.
These tacos were loaded with beef. Very filling. I was worried that I'd still be hungry, but they use the large tortillas and they were loaded. 
I'm happy to say that they were quite delicious. Even my wife who is Mexican really enjoyed the food here. And she's hard to please when it comes to Mexican food. 
I had one of my wife's al pastor tacos and it was soooo flavourful. I highly recommend this one as well. 
The hot sauce was nice and hot too if you like your food spicy. 
My only knock, was that the service was a bit slow. Other then that, this place is the real deal.",2
King’s Tacos,2,2017-10-07,"A disappointment for vegetarians. I'd read about King's tacos on Yelp and on some Facebook discussions and expected to be pleasantly surprised by their home-style serving style and innovative veggie options. Sadly that did not happen. 

We ordered the veggie tacos and were excited to try the welcome chips and salsas. Turns out at least one of the salsas has chicken stock - why!? - and the rest were just watery meh. 

The veggie tacos were fine at best. Pretty oily and just boring. And, finding a meat piece in the veggie mix was the final straw. Definitely won't be back and still in search of a decent veggie taco in Toronto. Tips welcome!",0
Taverna Mercatto,3,2019-11-20,"I landed in Toronto on the day it was snowing a lot. It was the beginning of the snow season. After checking into Airbnb, I was looking at nearby places to have a good meal. I tried to visit this place. The ambience is pretty nice and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I went onto try their spaghetti. I didn't like it much as I felt it wasn't properly cooked plus it didn't have much flavor. I finished my meal with Caramel Coppetta dessert (Cookie Crunch Gelato with Roasted Peanuts) and Tiramisu. Tiramisu was again a let down but I loved the Caramel Coppetta. So, overall I would say the experience was pretty average.",1
GB Hand-pulled Noodles,5,2019-11-02,"Got there on a Friday around 12:30 so I waited about 15 minutes for a table for 2. Hubby and I split a mega special Lanzhou beef noodle with the picked daikon radish side and jellyfish side.

Broth is perfectly seasoned (I asked for them to make it spicy and to add green onions and coriander/cilantro). Broth may seem bland to a lot of non-Asians but it was just right because of eating it with aforementioned side dishes. 

The noodle makers scared the $hit out of me when I was waiting in line because they didn't start pounding the noodles until about 10 minutes in. 

Paying bill is easy, multiple card readers on hand.",2
Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,2,2017-08-06,Really disappointed. We ordered two dishes and wait like an hour for the fish. Maybe it is because we did not order the right thing. But generally i would not go there again.,0
Lai Wah Heen,3,2020-05-17,"I give this restaurant three stars. I have been to Lai Wah Heen twice, most recently in January.

Lai Wah Heen is a upscale dim sum restaurant located on the second floor of the DoubleTree by Hilton, in downtown Toronto. The restaurant is spacious and bright, the staff is friendly and the service is excellent.

The dim sum is very good but there aren't many, if any vegetable options so it is quite heavy. Also, it doesn't seem very expensive but the price can increase rather quickly when you purchase a few of the higher priced dishes. The bill was higher when my wife and I went here in January than it was when we took our friend last year for her birthday. We particularly liked the crispy shrimp rolls served with sweet hawthorn sauce and the sticky rice filled with assorted seafood & meat, wrapped & steamed in lotus leaf. The spicy, sweet oyster sauce goes really well with the majority of the dim sum and the tea is excellent.

I will likely return to Lai Wah Heen sometime in the near future. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes dim sum and wants experience eating it in a high end setting. Three stars.",1
Ha Gow Dim Sum House,5,2020-03-20,"Went inside randomly cause I wanted some chinese food but didnt get the kind i was expecting. Needless to say this restaurant has completely opened my eyes to how delicious authentic chinese food is. You literally see these people make everything fresh infront of you too, its not some premade stuff they pull out of a container its legit ingredients. The people were super friendly and accomodating too, even though i walked in with no cash the guy pointed me out to a bunch of places with ATMs and apologized for it, was really chill even though I wasnt sure of what i wanted and suggested the safest choices and what he thought i would like. Stellar service, most places cant get you out of the door fast enough and i cant go back to those fake chinese food places, they dont compare to this hidden gem. If you're in Toronto and you want good food get it from here people!",2
Swatow Restaurant,5,2019-12-28,"Stopped by this restaurant with my parents for nostalgic reasons. They both raved about it being the best place for noodles since they were in high school. They said it's one of the few places that had authentic Shantou noodles. So we tried the noodles with fish slices, fish balls, and beef brisket. The noodles instantly reminded me of the ones I had in Chiuchow and Shantou, which I still dream about. The broth was light, the noodles were cooked firm, and the fish balls were flavourful. The beef brisket was tender and juicy. Although these noodles can't exactly replicate my experience back in China, it did hit the mark! After finishing our noodle bowls, we also took out some fish balls to cook at home. It was such a satisfying and comforting meal. Looking forward to coming back for more noodles!",2
Mariachi’s Restaurant,3,2019-06-06,"So this is my first trip to Canada and I decided to try this place because of a picture I saw of a margarita. So of course,  I did go and order that drink. I asked for a frozen margarita but it was far from frozen. It looked like the machine had melted. They made me another and it looked great but it wasn't sweet. 

I did order the quesadilla with chorizo. It was delicious. They served it Spanish rice and a side salad. First time I've been to a Mexican restaurant and I didn't get black beans. I had the habanero sauce with it and it was super spicy but I live for spicy food!",1
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,5,2020-03-15,"I miss their Thai food there!
The curry and Tom yum soup are always two of the dishes that I always ordered! Must try if you loveeee Thai food! :)",2
La Marquesita,5,2019-04-25,"I recently visited La Marquesita, and I have to say I really enjoyed their taquito, they lightly pass the tortilla through oil (makes it a little crunchy) and the filling for the beef is incredibly delicious -- spice levels can also be adjusted to your own taste. Whilst I haven't tried much else on the menu, the one thing I did have was pretty legit. I'd put it above the beef taco at 7 lives which is currently top rated in Toronto right now. Looking forward to going back! 

If you're hesitant to try due to limited reviews, I hope my suggestion urges you to try!",2
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,3,2020-02-08,"For a party of 3, we ordered 3 set meals and 2 drinks, and we left with our stomachs pretty full. This is my 3rd time at this location, but unfortunately stars were docked off for quite an uncomfortable experience. 

Made a reservation for a party of 3 for 6:30pm on a Tuesday, what we were given was a small table for 2 with a small stool at the side of our table, with my back to the adjacent customers table at a corner, which essentially felt like I was in the middle of the walkway. Throughout the entire dinner, I had felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable as I had felt the waiters/waitresses' bodies touching mine every time they came by to serve food to the table behind me. We've requested 2 times, when the restaurant was not packed for a larger table, but nothing was to be done. Unsurprisingly, I felt like we were being rushed in finishing our plates one right after the other as there were no room at all to fit any dishes anymore. 

If we had proper seating and space, I believe the experience would have been that much greater.",1
Sugo,4,2020-01-24,"Dropped by Sugo on the west end for some late dinner on a Thursday night. We got there just after 8 but it was still super busy! We had to wait an hour to get a table. However, there is a thrift store nearby so we went and walked around there until the table was ready. 

The food arrived super quickly after we ordered which was really nice. We got the spaghetti and meatballs plate, as well as the rigatoni and garden salad. They do shares plates for $3 off, and I believe its around the same portion as a regular plate. Each plate came up to around $20. The portions are huge!! I think the bolognese spaghetti size is larger than the rose rigatoni just because of the pasta difference but they were both amazing! They also have a lot of sauce at the bottom which I love. I also really liked the meatball which was really big. I feel like there could be more herbs in the dishes but that's also my personal preference. The garden salad had a lot of dressing but it was a pretty good size. We had enough leftover for two takeout boxes for lunch the next day.

The service here is so sweet! They are very welcoming and accommodating with everything. I would recommend coming early to avoid the wait. It is a small restaurant, but I do like how cozy again. I would come back if I'm in the area, also to try the tiramisu!",2
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,3,2019-11-04,"Heard a lot of hype about Kinka from friends who've been here previously and I wanted to love it but the volume level and food ultimately is what makes me give this place 3 stars. 

It's ABSURDLY loud, can't hear the person next to you talking; get ready to scream your order out. Most of the food was fine to not good but some of the things that I did find pretty delicious was the buta kakuni, miso black cod (albeit way too bones), and the yaki udon.

The karrage had too much batter and was hella dry, salmon oshizushi was bland, takoyaki and okonomiyaki was really w/e.

Basically I've had the same dishes better and at a reasonable volume at other places. Kinka is ultimately a turn up spot and if you treat it as such you won't be disappointed.",1
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,1,2019-07-19,"Thought this place would live to the rating but it fell flat, and flavorless. We ordered our food and it literally came in 2 minutes. (Yikes!)

Everything was bland and lacking sauce. Service was nice and welcoming, but the food was just subpar and overpriced. I'd save your money.",0
Comal y Canela,5,2020-01-09,"Having lived in the states enjoying variety of authentic Mexican food, after moving back to Toronto, I have been fairly disappointed and greatly missed real Mexican food. Coma y Canela saved me. Their food is purely authentic. They make everything home made, even the Mole sauce. You will never be disappointed eating here. The only thing is there are not enough seating and you may have to wait for seats if you visit during busy lunch/dinner time.",2
Mexico Lindo,4,2020-06-03,This is one family owned restaurant I love to go. Food are very good. Place is tiny but always have a seat!,2
House of Gourmet,2,2020-03-30,"Review is for take out. Normally when I order crispy chow mein, other restaurants will separate the sauce and the noodles. Not here, by the time I got home the noodles were all soggy  

The shrimp spring roll was such a disappointment with barely any shrimp, only one bite actually had shrimp in there. 

I ordered via Ritual so I thought the pick up would be simple. There is absolutely no physical distancing at all, the entrance was tight, people were crammed and confused, overall it was chaotic. Improvement needed.",0
Terroni,1,2020-03-18,"This place is definitely deceiving with all the good reviews. The food is not particularly good and we ordered a great variety of food so we could try a little bit of everything. The service was lacking and the mandatory tip amount is fairly high for big groups which we felt they did not deserve. The free bread they handed out at the beginning was not enough for the amount of people we had. We expected them to give us one per person at least and they did not warn us that we would be charged for it when we asked for more when we realized there was not enough for everyone. When the bills came and we asked about it, the server very rudely said if you just don't want to pay go talk to my manager. A lot of us will never come back to this restaurant.",0
Donatello Restaurant,3,2019-08-17,Food was mediocre at best I'm sad to say. The pastas and salads were very generic and like I can make that myself at home. Bread was warm which was nice and the atmosphere of both the outside downstairs/upstairs patios and the interior was nice.,1
Fusaro’s Kitchen,3,2017-12-10,"I ordered the Siciliana pasta. For the prices that everything is on the menu, it's definitely worth it. We all got a pretty big portion. In terms of taste however, it didn't really blow me away. 

Although the food took quite some time to get to us (30 minutes) the service was great. I had this waitress from Ireland who was quite nice. When I wasn't sure of which wine to get, she also brought me tasters. 

Overall, it's a good place for fairly cheap Italian food but it didn't blow my socks off.",1
Xola Mexican Food,5,2019-09-24,"If you're in the mood for authentic Mexican this is the place.  Best Margaritas, my favourite guacamole is blue cheese with walnuts: cactus one is also pretty divine.  Amazing mexican music & totally worth every penny.",2
Como En Casa,2,2018-03-27,"Two words can summarize my thoughts on the food here: overpriced and bland. I was super stoked to try Como En Casa because (1) I LOVE Mexican food and (2) fellow Yelpers have given this place such glowing reviews. We placed a takeout order on a Friday night. I ordered a small chicken burrito and my husband ordered a large verde burrito with beef. When I called and placed the order on the phone, the person asked me ""if guacamole was okay"". I said yes. To my chagrin, the guacamole was an extra charge, and we ended up paying nearly $30 for two burritos. I recognize that it's partly my fault for not checking if guacamole was extra, but I thought the way that I was asked suggested it was included, and they were asking if I wanted it on my burrito. Just seemed kind of slimy, if you ask me. 

All of this (including the high-ish price tag) would have been fine if I enjoyed my burrito. Negative. The meat was incredibly dry and bland. I barely had any chicken in my burrito, and if I did manage to snag some meat, it tasted like chewy old chicken. The burrito was mostly rice with, like, one piece of lettuce. I barely tasted a tomato or anything to break up the rice. I didn't notice any beans or sour cream. Honestly, this was a terrible burrito. I think I'm pretty easy to impress with Mexican food, but this was just horrible. My husband didn't like his either. I won't be wasting my precious Friday-night cheat meal on this place.",0
Lai Wah Heen,2,2019-06-08,"Stopped by on a Sunday for some dim sum, having visited previously ~6 years ago and recalling an enjoyable visit. Lai Wah Heen is on the second floor of an aging Doubletree Hotel in Chinatown. The hotel has seen better days, but the dining room is fine and clean, if dated. Our experience with the food on this visit was quite mediocre. While nothing was off putting, the flavor and quality were not a good as we had remembered, and certainly a far cry from our best dim sums in China/HK. Honestly, there were no clear highlights. Service was above average for a Chinese venue, i.e. you don't have to flag down a waitress, but nothing to write home about. While we are out-of-towners, believe there are probably better options for dim sum.",0
Eataly,3,2020-02-20,"I went on a Wednesday night around 8pm and was surprised there still many people, however, the wait for a table is not long.  Staff are all very friendly and very informative as I was asking about what wine to drink and etc.  The place is bright and clean but the only thing was I think (at least that's what I believe) there was only one washrooms to share for the entire Eataly.  
Food: the kale salad is a must!  It was so tasty!  The pasta was cooked to my liking (i asked a little cooked over al denta) and pizza was ok.  Overall I would come if there is no long wait.  And I still need to try their desserts!",1
Kit Kat Italian Bar & Grill,1,2019-08-19,I can't tell you anything about the food as we left after 15 minutes and the waitress not even close to coming to our table.  9:00 at night not the time for the waitress to be telling jokes.,0
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,1,2020-02-09,"Not even going to talk about the food here because the service here was abysmal. We asked for 3 cups of hot water and were charged $1.50/cup. When we asked the waiter why they charge for hot water they mentioned that all restaurants in yorkville charge for water. After suggesting some of the restaurants  we regularly visit that offer complimentary hot water, the waitress said, ""I guess those restaurants aren't high end anyway...""

I'm sorry, kasa moto and one have $$$ and $$$$ ratings while this barn has $$. Snobs.",0
Stelvio,3,2018-12-31,"I really have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I dined here for dinner and tried quite good amount of food from appetizer to pastas. I feel like this place is better for lunch as portions are small and the vibe and lighting in the restaurant was too light for me for an evening dinner. I loved the black and white simple decor, however I would definitely recommend having less light towards evening. 

As for the drink, I tried the Pinot Grigio, and I loved it. If you like an easy white wine with notes of sweetness, this would be perfect.

For appetizer, we ordered a cheese and cold cut board. I was not impressed with the selection of cheeses there. There were two types of cheese and two types of cold cuts. Both cheeses tasted very bland and simple. The portion was fairly good though and it came with a honey and house-made jam which was a nice garnish to it. We also got the meatball to share by the server's recommendation. Probably this was my least favorite item. It was different from a usual Italian meatball you imagine, maybe it is the Milanese way. However I did not like it and it was too dry and meaty. We asked for a side tomato sauce so we can dip them in it.

For main, we ordered two different pasta dishes, the Tagliatelle al funghi porcini and Casoncelli alla bergamasca. They make the pastas fresh in house which I think is what makes this restaurant special. The funghi pasta tasted really good and I loved the mushrooms in it, however I felt it was lacking sauce. Casoncelli alla bergamasca was a meat ravioli with some butter sauce on it, however there was just a little butter sauce on it and it tasted very basic to me. I would say both pastas had very small amount of sauce and both tasted very simple.",1
Hong Kong Bistro Cafe,1,2019-12-31,"Just prepared that you may wait more than 50 mins for food serving. i came here twice. each time me and my friends will waiting more than 50 mins for food after we ordered. no matter how many customers in here. they are always very slow. even fried rice, they will take that long.

And the fried rice. Are not totally sauced... even it took 50 mins to make.",0
Khao San Road,4,2020-02-22,"I normally go for red curry but decided to try the yellow curry for the first time as it was the special of the day. I loved it, the potato's are a great touch. 

Will definitely be back soon to take advantage of the curry of the day lunch special!",2
House of Gourmet,3,2019-04-19,"House of Gourmet is a great spot for late night Chinese food with huge portion at reasonable price! However, don't expect anything extraordinary because you get what you pay for. 

On all of my visits, even ones at 2AM, the place was constantly busy so service always seemed so rushed. The restaurant offers a several options of typical Chinese dishes such as dumplings, fried noodles/rice, soup, etc. My go-to is definitely seafood congee! It is cooked to just the right consistency, not too watery or too thick. Seafood includes shrimp, fish fillet, abalone, scallop, squid and small pieces of ginger that really brings out the flavor! The portion for a small congee is super filling that will likely keep you full until the next meal. I've also tried their noodles soup with BBQ duck & BBQ a few times but it was meh. One time I'd find the broth to be too bland, and other times it was so salty. Other than that, the noodles also comes with generous amount at decent price.

Overall, House of Gourmet is definitely a good choice for late night food, but the quality doesn't really stand out from other restaurants.",1
Juicy Dumpling,5,2020-02-10,"I think I have found a favorite place for food if you're on a budget, and also as a student! Located around Dragon City Mall at Chinatown, this is a popular quick eats place for delicious soup dumplings as low as $2.99 for 6! There are limited seats inside, and by the window, however since it's a quick meal, people tend to leave pretty quickly. Their menu offers a variety of soup dumplings, rice and also juicy fried buns. One thing I don't usually see in other Shanghai restaurant is pan fried versions of soup dumplings, so I definitely had to make an order of that. After ordering with the cashier, you will get a beeper that will ring when youre order's ready.

The food came fairly quickly after ordering. The soup dumplings are what youd get at regular Shanghai restaurants; super juicy and tasty!! I was honestly so surprised how delicious they were as I was skeptical at first due to the low price. The fried juicy buns were a bit small compared to other places, but for the price, you cant complain, and plus they were also very juicy inside as well. The pan fried soup dumplings were also surprisingly juicy as well as I was worried the heat from pan frying them would take it away. All in all, we ordered 4 things and the bill came up to be $16!",2
El Charro,2,2019-05-26,"Located just across the street from the Broadview TTC station the place is hard to miss. A no frill joint with simple Mexican decor. Based on the reviews ordered the 3 for10$ tacos : Asada, steak and chorizo... I had a lot of hope , but crash landed my expectations with dry and not so fresh tacos. Honestly not at all up to the mark. Wife ordered a tostada with tinga de pollo ( chicken) and was equally disappointed with the serving size and taste. We definitely need to go back to Seven Lives to reset our experience.",0
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,5,2019-12-12,"Put this place at the top of my list to try in Toronto, and it did not disappoint. The place is huge! If you have a large party, I would recommend making a reservation. There are so many options to choose from, but we went with the lobster tower (4 course meal). This includes, snow pea leaves, lobster tower, fried rice and dessert which was just macarons. The lobster tower was delicious! So much flavor! No sauce needed. The service was really nice, they came by and changed our plates and asked us what we needed a couple of times. 


Note: It is cash only!",2
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,3,2019-04-01,"The interior here is spacious and clean, which makes it a good place for happy hour or business meals. The servers were quick, but it took some effort to get their attention sometimes. 

We had the dan dan noodles, pork belly over rice, XLB, and pan fried dumplings. Although this was a mix of appetizers and dimsum, the amount of food was just enough for us. My favorite was the dan dan noodles, especially with the hot chili oil for those that like spice. 

Overall I had a good dining experience but was a bit disappointed with the dimsum selection. I was looking for a good dimsum restaurant in Chinatown and, for being labeled a dimsum restaurant, there wasn't that much.",1
Nodo Restaurant,3,2018-07-04,"The food over at the St. Clair location is way better as well as the service. You can check out my review there. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela",1
Zhang’s Kitchen,4,2020-01-28,"Got the chance to try out Zhang's Kitchen and it was pretty good! We went early in the afternoon so we were the only ones in the restaurant; however there were a couple of people doing take out. 

The interior of the restaurant is very clean and simple and I was super impressed! The staff are friendly and attentive. I enjoyed how they served warm water infused with lemon - perfect on a cold winter day. We sat down and you order using the paper menu. We got the small braised beef brisket with noodle, the braised beef noodles (with soup) and the spicy sliced beef cold dish. You can customize your order and I added some quail eggs and bok choy and they don't skimp on the quantity!

The dishes arrived quickly and the portions were huge! There were large chunks of meat and the noodles were well cooked and flavourful. I particularly liked the spicy sliced beef. Overall, it was a very pleasant and filling meal and would swing by again if in the area.",2
Artisan Plus,3,2019-09-14,"Overall, an OK noodle spot. Interesting to try out but not a must-try. 

I ordered the Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian (which the waitress mentioned was their most popular dish) and the Shuan Tofu Sheets:

Biang Biang Mian: The plate is quite large so if you're hungry this is the dish to order. The noodles were pretty tasty/chewy and the beef tasted good but the rest of the plate didn't really stand out and was loaded with vegetables (see picture).

Shuan Tofu Sheets: Again, another OK dish but wasn't amazing. While the flavor is there from the peanut and sesame sauce, the texture of the tofu was off-putting after a few strands. We didn't finish the dish. 

If you're looking for spicy noodles, give this restaurant a try. Otherwise, tons more noodle places to eat around Yonge-Dundas.",1
Mexico Lindo,5,2020-02-23,"Ordered for the first time but I've heard so many great things about this place...
WOW
The portions are huge! Very hearty and fresh.
Everything stayed perfectly hot and ready.

The chicken was so tender and flavourful. 

I'll definitely have to get other things from the menu!",2
MEXITACO,2,2019-03-02,"Ordered take out on a Saturday evening; Chicken Wings ($12.99), Burrito De Carne Asada ($12.99), and the Quesadillas De Tinga ($8.99). Staff were not overly friendly, ignoring me upon entry, servicing a walk-in couple before me, and assuming I was a food delivery courier.... The portions were all small, especially the SIX wings, yes only 6, which tasted OK. The burrito was one of the worst I've had in the city, lacking any flavour, and the Quesadillas was average. The sour cream that came with the Quesadillas was also questionable as it tasted, and had the consistency of being watered down. At a $25 price point this meal might have garnered 3 stars.

I will never return.

Aside: I noticed they charge $8.50 for pints which I thought was pricey. For reference The Keg charges the same price their craft beer selection.",0
Buca Yorkville,3,2020-02-16,"The entrance was a bit hard to find, since there was no door / entrance off of the main street (where the restaurant's address was). You need to go into the Four Seasons Hotel area, turn left, and it's the last door by the fence (it's right across from the side entrance of Four Seasons Hotel). There's no obvious sign indicating where the restaurant is, until you actually get to in front of the door.

The food tastes good, but nothing too special. Portion sizes of the pasta are a bit on the small side. The vegetable sides are quite good and rightly portioned. Service is attentive and just like in any other higher-class restaurants.",1
La Chilaca Taqueria,3,2018-08-06,"3.5 stars to some more great options of 4 stars.  Not going to lie... it's true Kensington in every sense of the neighbourhood.

If you're willing to look past the rough and gritty exterior, you may find some good tacos here.  Nothing risked is nothing gained and I feel that La Chilaca Taqueria fits that perfectly.  It's in the 'food court' of several Latin American food stalls.  Food court is an understatement... It's more like a disheveled, heavily worn and dirty open non A/C store that has every stall spilling out into a small room.  It shares the space with 3 other stalls.  

There are some tables in the back of the dingy place but there's a weird smell emanating from the back as you sit beside several broken old unused glassed counters.  On a crazy hot day, the lack of A/C makes this insane and feel like an oven.  The open back door to a few more seats barely helps.  The 'kitchen' is really a small stove top and a crammed setting of a kitchen sink and a counter to assemble.  

You're quickly greeted and told to look up at the menu.  There are daily deals like 2 chorizo tacos for $5 or 4 other tacos for $10.  Each taco is $5 each regardless of the type.  When we went, the carnitas werent ready but they had 8 other ones you could try.  Service here is efficient but I have to admit they were all busy with the World Cup... can't blame them since the entire Kensington (let's be real... Toronto) is watching.  I do have to worry a bit when we overheard the person in the kitchen saying how can they cook this chicken in under 3 minutes... ehhhh wut?  How about cooking it till it's done?

I have to admit the addition of their sauces really perked these up so grab some before taking a bite into them.  The creamy orange one has some good heat that could make you water up a bit if you're not careful.  I wasnt expecting that type of heat and wow, yeah... ice cream was needed to cool my tongue.  What I thought would be the spicy red transparent sauce was actually a tomato one that didn't have any heat and just added a little bit of flavour.  There was also a nice vibrant green sauce that was very good mix of mild jalalpeno, onions, and cilantro.  Totally refreshing to add.

Fish Taco - My favourite of the tacos.  The fish pan fried and still tender without being dried out.  This was a stuffed taco... the type where you take a bite and you realize that the sauce and pickled onions are just going to be exploding soon.  The sauce just oozes out onto your hand and you're soon licking your fingers.  The cilantro just gives a nice freshness to it... I know, not everyone likes cilantro but it's good on this one.  Another thing I love about this... they double wrap the taco so they dont fall apart easily AND they toast the corn tortilla up so they're a bit crispy.  Nice one. 4/5 

Vegetable Taco - Soooo I keep ordering Vegetable Tacos and I keep wondering why afterwards.  My search for a good one continues but I learned that tofu and cheese really doesn't work... at... all.  I feel like you do one or the other.  It's just a weird combination.  In addition to those, they had cilantro, pickled onion, and tomatoes. This one wasn't as flavourful so it really benefits from either the orange hot sauce (that will scorch you) or green fresh herb one.  3/5

Chorizo Taco - Another solid taco with the paprika giving the pork a nice flavour.  It was cooked fresh from the sausage and it didnt taste like it was standing in some pot for a few hours.  They garnished with pickled onions and cilantro and helped cut through the rich meat.  I was told this was authentic to the style in Mexico city.  4/5  

Beef Taco - Maybe I wasn't in the mood for cheese but the beef and cheese one didn't quite work.  As generous as they were with the cheese... I just felt this one was really quite heavy and a bit oily.  The beef was possibly a bit overcooked which made it a bit on the dry side.  I could have added more sauce to it but something didn't quite work as well as the chorizo.  3/5

Shrimp Taco - This was a solid one with small shrimps cooked fairly well.. they werent rubbery or dried out.  Just a nice juicy chew.  They added a spice to it that kept it out of the bland side ... though I have to admit, this wasn't as flavourful as the Chorizo.  This one does work well with a sauce to keep it from being boring.  They did garnish with the usual pickled onions and cilantro.  3.5/5

There are some really good tacos coming out of here and made freshly with some in house made sauces that really make the tacos pop.  BUT if you're the type where you're concerned about atmosphere, this might put you off.  Worse case, you can take it to go and eat it while you're walking about Kensington but just bring a few napkins, ok a lot... cause you're going to be leaving a trail of food dripping otherwise!",1
Ho Ho Barbeque,3,2018-02-27,"FOOD: 2.5 stars
PRICE: 4 stars
SERVICE: 4 stars

I came here after reading many good reviews about how tasty their food was.  I looked for something to grab it home after picking up my adorable macarons at DaanGo Cake lab.


We ordered 3 boxes of meat on rice; one with roasted pork, another one was roasted duck and the last one was bbq pork.  It comes with either tofu or vegetable on the side.  We only chose vegetable because my husband isn't a fan of tofu. You can also choose to have either a drink or soup along with your meal too.  The price for bbq meat on rice is around $6.50-$8.50.  Isn't it a good deal?  The staff was very nice and friendly.  I wasn't sure if they were the owners or not. I really couldn't tell.  I don't live in the area and it was my first time here. 

The portion was generous however the meat was quite dry.  The bbq pork was ok.  It was better than the roasted pork and roasted duck.  The roasted pork wasn't crispy as I expected and there was little meat on the roasted duck.  

As all above, the food I ordered was mediocre or maybe it wasn't my day.  Anyway, the price was good.  Three meals were only $22.50!  It's pretty good right!?",1
Chula Taberna Mexicana,2,2018-12-23,"I came last summer and had an amazing dinner, I remembered the tacos to be rich in flavour and super affordable which was a big stand out to me since a lot of other taco places that charge upwards of $7/8 per taco. I dare to say that this WAS my favourite taco place at the time.

I came back this month for the first time in nearly a year and things were a lot different. For Tacos, I ordered the Biztec de Carne and the Carnita and they ended up tasting exactly the same, which was disappointing and weird since they have a lot of different ingredients altogether. Also there seemed to be a lot of liquid in the taco filling because halfway through eating one of my tacos it fell apart due to the moisture. Also, in all of the tacos, there seemed to be this weird crunchy/salty/sweet ingredient that I couldn't tell what it was. It was really odd, and gave the tacos a weird flavour/texture profile. This was not the same as what I ate a year ago, and they seemed to be more expensive than I remembered.

The one thing that stayed consistent however was their amazing Churro Sundae - everyone in the restaurant seemed to be ordering this. Their Churros were seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the caramel ice cream pairs perfectly - its one of the best churro desserts in the city in my opinion, and would come back just for this.",0
Ramen Isshin,5,2019-11-03,"I've had Ramen Isshin bookmarked for months now and finally got a chance to try it out this weekend. I had very high expectations for this place, especially since I've been looking forward to it for so long. I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed at all! 

We ordered the white sesame shio ramen and black tan tan noodle because they looked unique. These ended up being excellent choices. The white sesame shio ramen broth was light but had an addictive flavor, I found myself scooping for more and more broth with every bite. The black tan tan noodle broth had a very deep unique flavor, I've never tasted anything quite like this in the past. It is a thicker broth than the white sesame shio. It's so hard to explain the flavors, but I highly recommend both! The noodles and pork were great as well but the broths definitely made a more lasting impression. Oh and the sesame grinding was pretty fun as well.

No complaints with the service or the shop. The staff was nice, food came out promptly, and the shop was clean. We went right when they opened for lunch so we didn't have to wait, but the shop filled up within the first half hour and by the time we left there was a line already. Overall a great ramen shop, I'll definitely be back to try out other items on the menu!",2
Hotopia Downtown,3,2019-11-12,"I walk by Hotopia most days on my way home from work, and if you've ever passed by, you've probably smelled that strongggg spicy spice from outside. Maybe just walking by has even cleared your sinuses. It's been packed (usually with a line up) most nights when I've passed by which is why I've waited so long to check it out, but a few friends and I finally made our way here for dinner this past Sunday. I put my name on the Yelp waitlist for five people for 6pm, which turned out to be unnecessary as there were several empty tables when we arrived. (The restaurant got busy later around 7pm, and there were a few groups waiting for tables).

We have varying levels of spice tolerance between the five of us, so we ordered three dishes to share: pea sprouts in broth, steamed chicken with chili sauce, and the Sichuan pepper numb basa. The pea sprouts were the only non-spicy dish we ordered, and it was pretty standard as far as Chinese pea sprout dishes go (including the high price point). The steamed chicken wasn't too spicy and quite oily - watch out for the bones! The Sichuan pepper numb basa was the main dish that we ate with rice - it's definitely spicy, but not too numbing (as long as you avoid actually eating the peppercorns themselves, which I definitely did). There were quite a lot of pieces of basa as well as eggplant, and despite sweating and turning red from the spice, we found ourselves finishing everything. 

Service is pretty friendly, and they were fast to fill up our water (which we definitely needed). The bill came to ~$14 per person which was pretty decent for such a filling meal. This isn't my favorite type of Chinese cuisine as I'll admit, I can't really handle the heat. But I'm definitely interested in coming back to try some other dishes!",1
Ramen Isshin,5,2020-01-06,"Cozy Ramen place with excellent service! Loved the spicy miso Ramen - I liked how the Ramen was loaded with sprouts, gave it a different feel altogether! Pork was amazing and juicy! I also tried their sake cocktail- I am a sake lover now! 
Definitely visiting again !",2
La Vecchia Ristorante,3,2019-08-15,"La Vecchia is a cute restaurant with great ambiance near Yonge & Eglinton. It is filled with wooden tables and twinkle lights. 

The service is great. We didn't make a reservation for dinner but snagged a spot at the bar. Both the bartender and our server checked in with us frequently. Our water was constantly filled up and we were asked if we desired further drinks throughout the experience. 

While the food was good, it was simply average. We had the penne alla vodka (gluten free) and the capricciosa pizza. Unfortunately, only a handful of the pasta options could be made gluten free, and none of the pizza could be made gluten free. This was fairly limiting. 

There are various delicious Italian restaurants in the area and unfortunately this one simply didn't stack up (both in taste and gluten free options). I would certainly come back for drinks (I had a delicious Aperol spritz) but would likely not come back for the food.",1

7 Numbers Restaurant,2,2017-02-05,"I can't believe there are such high ratings for 7 numbers. I had high expectations for this place before coming due to the reviews. But it was about a 2.5 imho.

Shared the following with hubby...

Arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $12
- This was the best dish of the evening (sad isn't it? It was just a salad). I liked it as the goat cheese was part of the dressing. The red pepper was delish but wish the portion was bigger. A tad small for $12

Veal Lasagne - Lasagne with fresh-made pasta sheets, fresh ground veal, mozzarella, and housemade sauce $12.75 (large)
- Our friends ordered a small variation of this and honestly perhaps we should have ordered the small as well. It looked around the same size except it was on a slightly larger plate. There was too much pasta and sauce and too little meat. My friend called her small bowl a snack size pasta. Very saucy. That ""homemade"" sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes... But it wasn't that impressive. Tasted like something from a can. 

Meatballs - Big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, smothered in sauce $13
- I didn't like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it. There was only a small pinky tip size mozzarella bit in it. Wasn't even served hot. Way too much sauce. I ended up dipping bread with it.

As for service, the server who served us was very polite but the general manager Tom? (glasses with plaid shirt) was super rude. Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if I had known, I would have removed this table long ago (they attached another small table to one end). I think he could have handled the situation a lot better. Thanks for denting the mood of a friend's birthday. We noticed Tom kept giving our table dirty looks as well. At least the food came pretty quickly and our server always made sure things were ok. 

Not coming back again. No one was full and we got wings afterwards.",0
Mexico Lindo,3,2017-06-18,"We came here for Father's Day dinner on a slow Sunday. On google, it said the restaurant was closed on Sunday but apparently not ( they are open until 9pm), however when we called for a reservation they said they don't take reservation on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and that they were open till 8 pm. 

Restaurant was almost empty and after eating the food here we understand why. Service was okay, food was so-so! Nothing extraordinary that I can talk about nor I would return for.",1
Famiglia Baldassarre,5,2019-07-01,"ugh i love this place so much but why is it so far and randomly located?!

If this was located in downtown Toronto, you can bet I'll go on a pasta diet for this place. Their pasta is insanely fresh (and you can see the team in the back cranking them out) but that also means it sells out fast.

I came 10 min before opening and there was already a line. By the time the store opened, there was a solid line building up behind me. You order at the cashier and they'll ask you if you're to-go or for here. If you ask for it for here, the nice thing is they won't make your pasta until there is a table ready. You can't sit until your food is ready which is nice in a way because no one can reserve the seat while their party is miles behind in the line. Once you are seated (if you're for here), your food will be ready in another 5-10 min.

A few helpful facts:
- This place is cash only 
- They change their menus pretty consistently 
- You should 1000% buy some extra pasta to bring home even if you're not sure because by the time you finish your pasta and decide you want to bring some home, the line will be insane and maybe sold out by the time you reach the counter
- They have complementary bread which is just as good
- I don't need to recommend any dish here because they'are all A++ so order what your heart wants and I can promise you it's going to be incredible!",2
Fishman Lobster Clubhouse Restaurant,5,2019-12-30,"I've been wanting to come here for many years and finally got the chance to this week. Expectations were sky-high and all I can say is that this place delivered! The lobster made HK-style was one of the best dishes I've had this year. Amazing! The soup, fried rice, and snow peas were good but nothing compared to the lobster. For two of us, we got the 6 lbs lobster package that was ~130 CAD before tax and tip. HK-style was $15 but it was worth it. The lobster came on top a bed of delicious French fries.",2

Grazie Ristorante,3,2019-12-14,"This restaurant was fantastic dealing with some menu modifications that allergies required. Usually there is pushback from the kitchen but not this place. For that we are grateful. 

The modified meal was good, well cooked and an ok all round meal. The pasta in both meals was properly cooked and fresh. The veal however, not as good. It had large sections of charred burnt meat and was quite dry. 

Overall, the service was great, food...mediocre.",1
La Marquesita,3,2019-05-18,"Food (3/5): decent. The corn chips were nice and crispy but the toppings were lacklustre in taste. There also wasn't enough sauce and cheese to cover the chips

Service (4/5): got this to go through ritual, the food was made fresh and there was only a very brief wait!",1
El Trompo Taco Bar,5,2018-09-05,"Just love el trompo

Agio,2,2019-07-27,"I came on a Monday around 5pm with two other people. We ordered 3 dishes (ravioli, lobster pasta and shrimp with veggies) and spent over 100$. Here is a short pros and cons list: 

Pros: 
- The food is good 
- The chef gave us some bread with butter, vinegar and olive oil on the side. He also gave us some baked zucchini as an appetizer. 
- He seems knowledgeable about Italian cuisine. He said that he cooked in Italy for 7 years. 
- a lot of street parking nearby

Cons: 
- The restaurant smells like cat. The odour was very strong. 
- The bathroom is in the basement with a very very low ceiling. It reminded me of the bathrooms one would expect to see at a campsite, so it's very usable, but lots of bugs. 
- The decor is very outdated. 
- Too expensive. The ravioli dish was composed of 4 big ravioli. The lobster pasta was also a fair portion. The shrimp with veggies was my main issue. It cost over 25$ if I recall correctly. It was 3 shrimp with a handful or two of steamed veggies. For the price we paid, we expected more. After we finished our meal, we were still not fully satisfied. We ended up going somewhere else and eating more. 

In my opinion, the cons greatly outweigh the pros. There are many other cleaner Italian restaurants that serve much more equally delicious food for the same price.",0
Blooming Orchid,1,2019-11-01,"NEVER ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT! We order from them at least 10 times a week, from our staff to our agents. And today they showed us how POOR their customer service is. We got food poisoning from their food and one of their employees called us disrespectful names. When we walked over to talk to the manager, one of their employees lied and said he was the manager AND the owner - told us he doesn't believe us and that we don't ever have to order from them again because our money doesn't keep their business open. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Save your money and order from a place you would feel valued as a loyal customer instead!",0

I don't need an ass-kissing or TLC at a fast food Chinese restaurant, this was depressing.  Waste of money, waste of time.",0
Fieramosca,2,2019-01-29,"I have one question: who are you people who gave this a 4 or 5 star rating??????
We visited for dinner on Saturday evening. When the server appeared to fill our water glasses using a plastic pitcher we knew it was a bad sign. Most disappointing dining experience. We made the reservation based on reviews. I'm simply shocked this restaurant has a 4.5 rating. The food attempts to be high end fine cuisine but is really just pretending. We had the caprese salad. The tomatoes were large (rock) hard basic garden tomatoes - served freezing cold. The mozzarella was rubbery, not creamy like a caprese salad should be. The arugula was a basic run-of-the-mill salad. Excessive and boring. I had the black cod special. The portion was huge and that was all it had going for it. The cod was served on a big bowl full of under cooked garden vegetables (carrots and cauliflower) with watery-tomato sauce. It was a dish you'd expect at a family restaurant chain. It wasn't served how black cod should be. My husband's excessive serving of orecchette was bland and served in a bowl of liquid. 

The only positive feedback we can share...the martinis were delicious and the server was lovely and friendly. 

It was a cold evening but the dining room was uncomfortably cold and the washrooms were FREEZING.  Yes, it was a very cold evening in the city but this is a restaurant - it should at least be warm. I understand the restaurant has been around for over 30 years - they've had plenty of time to figure out the heating. 

The dining room is old and tired, not in a charming way. There was paint peeling from the ceiling above us. We were seated at a table beside a shelf loaded with about 100 bottles of wine that hadn't been dusted in the restaurant's 30years. I've not seen a worse display of wine.

I loved that it was a family-owned restaurant - that's whey we went. It's low end and overpriced. This is not a Yorkville-grade restaurant. Save your money.",0

Hotopia Downtown,2,2019-11-17,"I recently checked out Hotopia with my friend because we wanted to try their sichuan pickled flavour fish soup.  You can choose different kinds of fish like basa fish.  We ended up with Tilapia.  The pot that came was big enough for 2 to 3 people.  My friend and I didn't manage to finish the pot.  The soup was actually pretty good.  It was more sour than spicy, but I liked the mix of flavours.  The Tilapia unfortunately was overly filled with bones.  I was surprised by this.  The staff didn't caution us about the bones, so we ended up spending the evening spitting them out, which was not my idea of an enjoyable meal.  
Maybe there is an alternative without bones.  I would like to go back and check out other dishes on the menu.  It's a fairly new restaurant, and was pretty packed when we were there.  But service was prompt.",0
Sichuan Garden Restaurant,3,2018-11-19,"I come to 川味轩 occasionally and every time think to myself ""oh no looks like they closed down"" because of the state of disrepair of the storefront.

I always get the lunch specials Kung Pao chicken, a tofu dish and spicy cold noodles which never disappoints. Lunch specials come with a soup of the day.

The interior is small and cozy. We were here for a late brunch on a Sunday and there was no wait at all. Service can be a little slow as Xola is more like a family run and with only 1 chef and 1 server working here during our visit.

We shared: 

Horchata ($3.50)
- I never really into Horchata and I found their version not as nutty and creamy as I preferred
- maybe adding rum to become Ronchata next time!

Burrito Lamb ($8.95)
- slow cooked pulled lamb was so soft and moist with a lot of flavour

Fish Taco ($15)
- fish has a nice and firm texture and the breading was so light and crispy!
- love the spicy mayo, guacamoles, pickled cabbage and everything just go so well together!

Good Mexican food is hard to find in Toronto and of course I would be coming back to Xola for more!",2

We were seated at a table that felt like it was a common walk way by the front door so requested if we could be moved and the waitress refused to move us saying she couldn't offer up a four person table to two people, even though there were plenty and the place wasn't even half full. 

On to the food: 
Bruschetta: bread used was good nice and toasted not overly hard. The tomatoes were tasteless and bland which ruins this dish no matter how good the bread is. Did not taste like bruschetta at all.

My wife ordered the rigatoni Bolognese with a rose sauce. She did not enjoy it at all saying it was watered down sauce with chunks of bland tomatoes. 

I had the penne ala vodka with meatballs as a sub for the bacon my dish was not bad  food came out piping hot, sauce was decent meatballs were small and tasteless.

When I confronted the owner he looked down at my plate and saw the roach and quickly took my plate and dashed to the kitchen before I had a chance to take a photo.

The only funny and bewildering part to this is that a group of people standing behind me waiting to be seated saw what had happened and witnessed the roach in my noodles and still decided to stay and dine !!!!

Asian Legend,1,2018-06-02,"Food was ok nothing special. 
The taste was more blend i don't know i thought after reading the reviews it will be a good place but I didn't like the food flavors. 
We ordered a lot of food.
After waiting so long that someone's gonna pick up our order.
To this counts noodle with beef, crispy fried noodles, veggies and dumplings and beef pancake.
Actually I liked the beef pancake and the dumplings.
When we were finished we ordered the bill. 
A lady came with the takeout boxes and then the drama starts I don't know the lady was packing the food and she throws angry the empty plate on the table. 
She got so upset first I thought I gave here to less tip and then I was like no it can't be. 
So she was so angry she went to the other waiters and keep on pointing to our table and she was like angry like no tomorrow. 
I was literally shocked what happen to her.  
Trying to ask but well she didn't speak English.
So I ignored them all of them. 
I don't know maybe she got mad that I couldn't finish my food.
So my advice for this place is nothing special. If you want some waiter getting angry at you for no reason sure go ahead. This place is not recommended from my side.",0
Fieramosca,2,2019-06-02,"Honestly, I don't know how this place averages 4.5 stars. My review would have been a 3.5 had it not been for the horrible service. 

My party made a reservation for about 12 people and we were given the room upstairs where other parties were dining as well. The layout and spacing in this restaurant are very tight so watch your step. The seating in the front doesn't quite make sense layout wise. When I walked up to the stairs me and an employee were basically dancing around each other to just get by each other...just why.

Our server the entire night honestly had an attitude problem. He basically had a stick up his ***. He was passive aggressive the minute we got there all the way to the end. He asked if we wanted appetizers and since we were waiting on a few people we asked for a couple of minutes. Unlike a regular waiter who would walk away and let you discuss he stood there hovering and just waiting for us to give him an answer before leaving. Even when he was putting dishes down he was just dropping them and tossing side plates here and there, it was completely unprofessional. It was time for pasta and while our waiter dished out the cheese another waiter helped with pepper. But the pepper waiter took a little longer than the cheese and you could hear our waiter yelling at the pepper waiter from the other room. Is this not supposed to be a classy environment? Why are you yelling at him in front of all the customers? 

Aside from the horrible service, the food was actually very good and the portions were huge! I ordered the Spaghetti Mare de Mario and the amount of seafood definitely did not disappoint! There were a ton of mussels but the spaghetti was not fully cooked. I had a chunk of it still stuck to each other and hard...

Overall I do not think this place deserves the rating it has based on this experience.",0

Harmoney Chinese Restaurant,3,2018-07-10,"[FOOD] - 3.5/5
I was highly anticipating my lunch here since I rarely find authentic Xian restaurants (Northwestern Chinese cuisine) in Toronto. I ordered Xian dishes such as the Steamed Lamb Pita Soup, the Chinese burger (Stuffed Pita), and the Northwestern Cold Noodles. My favourite item was the pita soup. The broth was just rich and flavourful... it would go great on a cold winter day. The cold noodles were a super refreshing part of the meal. Lastly, the Chinese burger (with lamb filling) was pretty good as well. The outer bun was crispy, not too thick, and quite delicious. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Okay, so I only gave 4/5 because my boyfriend speaks Chinese and the lady also speaks Chinese. She was quite nice and accommodating. It would've been nice if they had more than one server and spoke English. My boyfriend had to translate for the table of 14 next to us who could hardly understand the server. 

[OVERALL] - 3/5
While the restaurant can seem demeaning and unfriendly to non-Chinese speakers, it is a great place to go for highly authentic Xian cuisine.",1
Good Hombres,5,2018-11-17,"Good Hombres serve elevated tacos that bring sentiments of great, authentic Mexican food. Prepared with care and attention, this delicious meal is perfectly true in every way. On the northwest side of Dundas and Bathurst (look for the TACOS TACOS TACOS window), there is a little mystic tortilla-making machine that sends fresh, perfectly perfect tortillas onto a conveyor belt - made on demand. 

When you enter the modern, casual, grab-and-go, airy taco joint, you're greeted by colours of blue and yellow, stainless steel, and bar seating that lines the spacious frontline kitchen where you see the magic happen. The taco menu is diverse but everything is delicious. $3.75 per taco. Order 4 if you're hungry, 2-3 for a snack. The only seating is by the kitchen where there are condiments of pickled vegetables and a delicious ""salsa macha"" from Veracruz which is prepared with oil, chili and garlic. It's absolutely divine when drizzled on the tacos.

Their staple tacos, illustrated on a hand-written chalkboard menu, are colourful, whimsical creations that tickle your palate in flavours that are true to the history of the Mexican tortilla, and are served on fun bright vibrant plates:

1. Pastor: PORK shoulder, salsa macha, pineapple

2. Carne Asada: STRIPLOIN, salsa verde (green sauce)

3. Pescado: HADDOCK, lettuce, chipotle

4. Pollo Asado: CHICKEN thighs, salsa macha

5. Tinga de Pollo: CHICKEN breast, tomato, chipotle

6. Rajas Poblanas: roast poblano PEPPERS (a mild chili pepper from Puebla, Mexico), cotija (a hard cow's milk cheese from Mexico)

7. Chiles Toreados: shishito PEPPERS (a sweet, East Asian variety), black beans, salsa roja (red sauce)

8. Costillitas de Res: BEEF short ribs, salsa roja

9. Lengua: TONGUE, salsa macha, salsa verde

We had the tacos with haddock, beef short ribs, chicken tinga and tongue, and they were all flavourful bursts of juicy deliciousness; light and carefully crafted that looked so much fun to eat. It tastes like lots of time, effort, and love were folded in as the main ingredients in this timeless, traditional Mexican dish. We wanted to try them all-and we most definitely will next time (and as much as our waistline allows!).

On the menu, there's also:
- Quesadillas: $6
- Drinks: $2-3
- Masa (dough made from corn flour; used to make tortillas): $10/kg
- Tortillas: $14/kg

As a downtown Toronto Yelper, Good Hombres is midway between Dundas and Ossington (hipster mecca) and Chinatown (dim-sum heaven) and across the street from Toronto Western Hospital. But more importantly, it's a new taqueria that is worth coming back time after time for authentic, juicy, flavourful tacos that are a joy to eat. -Tell them Will and Justin from Yelp sent you here and wear your stretchiest pants, your belly will thank you.

Buca,5,2019-08-16,"Dinner for 4 on Thursday - Summer.  We were able to get in but highly recommend you to make reservation.  Two hosts, very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.  We were seated in the comunal table (sits 8, but no one else joined). Great view to the kitchen.

Ambience is modern, dressy.  Great for special occasions.  You will feel you are in a restaurant in Italy.  Big open floor but somehow allows for intimate conversations.  Most people were enjoying one another and their food.

Prosciutto and selection of 3 cheeses were very tasty.  Prosciutto directly from Parma.  Best cheese of the 3 was Parmigiano (other two were Peccorino and Mozarella di Buffala).

For entrees:  Capeletti was our favorite dish- pasta filled w ricotta, lemon sauce and mushrooms.  Maccheroncini was a close second call- tomato sauce was so tasty and natural!.  Pomodoro e Tartufo pizza was done to perfection.  I noticed other reviews calling the weird shape of their pizzas.  Nothing weird about that.  Perfectly shaped and done Italian style.  Again, we felt we were in Italy.

Desserts: Torta Amalfi (almond based cake w fruit) was very tasty, recommend to share between 2 or 3.  Their gelatos were fluffy and flavorful.

Lastly, as expected, they had a very good selection of wines.  Their Italian list is very extensive.  We opted for a bottle of Nebbiolo and it paired very well w our dinner.",2
Los Guaca-Moles,1,2019-06-21,"I rarely ever review restaurants but this was extraordinarily mediocre. Fish stunk, guacamole was too hot (no flavour, just heat) and the service was slow. Don't bother",0
Seven Lives Tacos y Mariscos,4,2019-12-07,"I always had this place tucked away in my Yelp bookmarks but never made it until now. I dropped by with a friend for a snack after Christmas Market and it definitely lived up to it's wonderful reviews!

The restaurant is in the heart of Kensington Market and is pretty small. Only one table that fits about 6 and a bar area where you could stand. I got Gobernador and it was SO GOOD. I feel like this was also enhanced by the fact that we were starving since we are directionally challenged and spent about 15 minutes getting lost before finding the place ...

They were very generous with the toppings, lots of cheese, shrimp, and marlin. Everything was enveloped by two taco shells the outer one was crispier and the inner was soft providing a nice contrast.",2
Bamboo Kitchen,2,2014-01-12,"Good take-out place with well-priced specials each day for the price of $4.99 before tax.  Went here on a whim and ordered the Sunday specials of eggplant tofu on rice and BBQ chicken leg.  You get what you pay for.  Greasy more than flavourful.  It is delicious in comforting way.  The hot and sour soup was plenty hot but not sour enough.  Service was brisk and abrupt.  Seems to be frequented by students and there's a bit of a language barrier.

Not particularly motivated to try it again in the future no matter what the price point could be.",0
Taverna Mercatto,2,2019-09-05,"Came here for a late lunch with my boyfriend. Love the ambience and the decor of this place. Unfortunately, this was the highlight of the entire meal. Service was very lack-lustre, perhaps we caught them at a time when they were recovering from the lunch rush. A bit disappointing considering there were only a couple of tables and you'd think service would then be on point.

We shared the frutti di mare, some olives, and the chitarra carbonara, and a couple of glasses of wine. The frutti di mare was quite fresh, but the portion was quite small considering the price point. The olives were pretty delicious and was a great little appy. Unfortunately, the carbonara, which looked amazing was flavourless, dry, and lacked any seasoning. The egg itself was fantastic but barely provided any flavour or added any creaminess to the pasta.

I was really looking forward to finding a staple Italian restaurant nearby, but with all the other Italian restaurants in the area, I can't really think of any reason, why we'd come back to Taverna Mercatto.",0
Lee Chen Asian Bistro,4,2019-08-07,"Lee Chen Asian Bistro is a decent spot for Chinese food near the theatres and financial district. It may look small from the outside, but it's quite large and spacious in the inside. The interior is very clean with nice decor. It even has a small garden and mini running waterfall just outside of the restaurant (great if you can score a table by the window, facing the mini garden). The customer service is very attentive and superior for a Chinese restaurant (e.g. the servers come by your desk to ask if everything is ok a few times throughout the meal, which usually doesn't happen in most other Chinese restaurants).

The menu contains some typical Chinese dishes. During weekday lunch hours, they have a separate lunch ""combo"" specials which are pretty good. Each combo comes with a choice of carbs (white rice, brown rice, fried rice, or fried noodles), meal entrée (protein / veg choices), bowl of side salad, and a spring roll. I ordered the brown rice and it came in a cute bamboo container. The entrée was nicely presented on an edible open flower-shaped bowl made out of crispy wonton skin.

The restaurant is a great choice for having a business or team lunch. The large space can accommodate large parties if booked in advance. The ambience is also nice and not too loud.",2
KINKA IZAKAYA ORIGINAL,3,2020-03-12,"One of the oldest restaurants that I had been to. Since North York. It's always been a great experience with them! No matter was the lunch hours having great lunch sets and yummy fish; but also the dinner are always pretty impressive. The late snacks are pretty good too! 
Don't forget to try their cocktails if you drink! 
Overall a pretty good experience there although sometimes is too noisy to talk with frds",1
Dimmi Bar & Trattoria,3,2019-12-10,Came here for lunch with group of friends. Service was good and attentive. Food portion is small for the price. Finished the spaghetti meatballs and was still hungry. Probably will not come back.,1
Asian Legend,4,2018-09-25,"Been to other locations and this one was good for service and being in the heart of Chinatown..we see seeking solace in a familiar menu.

food was tasty but a little heavy with the white pepper with the beef and egg white soup dish.  dishes came out quickly and were large and shareable as always.

snowpea leaves were very tender and young..not woody at all.
pricey for Chinese food in Chinatown but well worth it.

not stroller friendly but thankfully good Samaritans came to the rescue!",2
Eataly,3,2020-01-08,"Overall a cool place to visit. I had no idea what this place was, until I heard all they hype about it. When I received a gift card for it, I finally decided to check it out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and as expected it was busy. Assuming that there was line ups for the first week it was opened, it wasn't too bad. 

To start off, space itself was modern and vibrant. It was nicely decorated and had a little of everything. There was a supermarket, which kind of wrapped around the whole 2nd floor. From hand made pastas, sauce, cheese and etcs., they had it all. Surrounding the market was a few take out and, dine in restaurants as well, as cafe's and dessert. They also seemed to have classes too! 

The dine in restaurants were of course busy and, there was a wait so we opt'ed out for the take out joints. For the pizza, there was a variety of them but sold out quick (but also seemed like they were made quickly). There was also a take out joint, right when you go up the escalators which, seemed to have a variety of dishes. The gelato was one of my favorite things there and, maybe the best in the city so that's worth giving it a try. The desserts and chocolate, also looked amazing!

Overall, it was a cool experience and, would visit again to try the restaurants and dessert out!",1
Buca,1,2019-05-22,"We came here (King St location) Tuesday evening to take our guests from Vancouver to a nice dinner. Buca has been my favorite Italian spots in Toronto and has been my top recommendation for good restaurants in the city. We never once had a negative experience at Buca until last night. It was very disappointing to be in such a classy restaurant only to be treated poorly by their servers. We ordered charcuterie and pasta amongst the 5 of us. As we finished our dinner, we had told our server to pack up my bigoli pasta. As I picked up my takeout box, I realized it was not what I ordered. I quickly told the server that this was not mine and to my surprise, she yelled ""f*** off"" and stormed off in the kitchen. We were in shock as to why she responded this way. She returned shortly after, visibly disgruntled, and told me to stay put while the manager comes to talk to me. The manager arrives and simply tells me to wait while they make a new one for me to take home. She was not apologetic at all. Mind you, we had to wait 30 minutes for them to make the pasta again and as soon as I received it, they did not even acknowledge the fact that it shouldn't have taken that long. 

Mistakes happen but under no circumstances should servers be swearing at their customers. We are extremely confused as to what led to such aggresive remarks when we were the ones who had to wait 30 minutes to get our takeout. Definitely not going back after this incident. Servers were rude and ruined our evening.",0
Levetto,2,2019-12-02,"Went for dinner with five friends to celebrate my birthday. The food was excellent until the waiter offer me complimentary dessert. After ""happy birthday"", I dug in to the mini cake. That's when my friend noticed the mould. One of my friends discretely sent the dessert back to the kitchen. The waiter did not offer us a word of apology or a discount. I found that quite surprising and unprofessional. The whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth - not sure I would return.",0
La Carnita,3,2019-11-10,"Casual, small place but conveniently located near the tiff building and Princess of Wales and Royal Alexandra theatres.
Lots of taco options and they do offer 1 or 2 vegan taco options. The shells are corn so gf.
you have to go up some stairs from the street to get in so not sure if there is an accessible entrance.
Make a reservation during TIFF.",1
Hotopia Downtown,2,2019-11-01,"Not for everyone, maybe an acquired taste. Had the Sichuan pickled basa as per other reviews and the flavours were just too strong. It would be nice to have a smaller portion version so new customers could try a wider spread and not feel so locked in. The single large $30 slightly tongue numbing, gingery sour soup was too much of a commitment for two people. Good initial taste but then it just becomes overwhelming. Definitely need a lot of rice for this dish.",0
